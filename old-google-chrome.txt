If you can only run Google Chrome < 115 on your system, you have to install your 
Chromedriver a different way than outlined in the checkHTML script. 

You can find the right zip here:

https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html

(you may need to change the $PATH variable)

You will need to run this command in order to set up the chromedriver:

sudo npm install chromedriver --chromedriver_filepath=/path/to/chromedriver_mac64.zip

If you have any other problems, you may need to check out this Stack Overflow article.

This documentation is for informational purposes only.  The Enable Project does not officially support any chromedriver
for Google Chrome < 118.
