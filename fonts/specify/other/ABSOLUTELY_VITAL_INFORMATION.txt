Specify is a sans-serif typeface with real variety. 
Drawn with precision by Måns Grebäck, it brings brilliance and design to your graphic profile, while being calm and reliable. 
Its 40 styles and support for all European languages guarantees that it will work in any context. 
Try using the Black styles for headlines, the Thin and Light for logotypes, and the Medium and Bold weights for body text. 
If you find the Normal width to be too timid, widen your words with the Expanded and Extraexpanded styles!
Or narrow your text down without leaving any information out with the condensed width.
