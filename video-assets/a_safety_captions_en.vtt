2
00:05.440 --> 00:06.520
Oh, hey there!

3
00:06.600 --> 00:09.000
I just got this letter
and I wanted to share it with you.

4
00:09.200 --> 00:12.120
Sarah G. from Scottsbluff, Nebraska, asks:

5
00:12.140 --> 00:14.860
Hey Uncle Cooper,
I noticed you love Cooper Tires.

6
00:14.920 --> 00:16.540
What makes them so great?

7
00:16.740 --> 00:19.620
Well, Sarah G. from Scottsbluff, Nebraska,

8
00:19.660 --> 00:23.240
first let me say,
your powers of observation are impressive!

9
00:23.360 --> 00:25.200
I <i>am</i> a big fan of Cooper Tires.

10
00:25.360 --> 00:27.460
Second, let me ask you this:

11
00:27.640 --> 00:29.420
What do <i>you</i> look for most in a tire?

12
00:29.640 --> 00:33.220
I bet at some point in your thought process,
the word safety came to mind,

13
00:33.400 --> 00:37.700
and that is one of the reasons
I love Cooper Tires so much.

14
00:37.880 --> 00:39.380
I gotta be honest with you.

15
00:39.560 --> 00:42.760
Tires are the four things that
keep your vehicle connected to the road.

16
00:42.760 --> 00:44.840
In other words,
a lot’s riding on them...

17
00:44.840 --> 00:46.140
...pun intended!

18
00:46.140 --> 00:50.600
That’s why Cooper is dedicated to
making tires you can rely on mile after mile

19
00:50.780 --> 00:53.140
and you could even say that
they’re obsessed with safety

20
00:53.140 --> 00:55.320
in a heroic and endearing kinda way.

21
00:55.520 --> 00:58.520
In fact, if you went to an amusement park
with a Cooper engineer,

22
00:58.520 --> 01:02.380
I wouldn’t be surprised if she made herself
your dedicated ride buddy for the day!

23
01:03.300 --> 01:06.380
Listen, they got a program
where Cooper employees

24
01:06.380 --> 01:09.620
visit various schools
and educate teens on tire and safety.

25
01:09.620 --> 01:11.940
They've been around for over a century.

26
01:11.940 --> 01:14.660
And they’ve always made
tires you can depend on.

27
01:14.660 --> 01:16.220
What more could you want?

28
01:16.220 --> 01:18.800
So, Sarah G. from Scottsbluff, Nebraska,

29
01:18.800 --> 01:20.800
I guess that’s the long way of saying

30
01:20.800 --> 01:26.500
I love Cooper because it’s safety first,
second, and third when it comes to their tires.

31
01:26.600 --> 01:28.600
And who doesn’t like the sound of that?

32
01:29.560 --> 01:30.600
Go with the Coopers.
