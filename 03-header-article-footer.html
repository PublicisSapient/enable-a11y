        <h1>Hurricane Irene</h1>

   
        <p>Hurricane Irene was a long-lived Cape Verde hurricane Atlantic hurricane during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.
            The storm formed near Cape Verde on August 4 and crossed the Atlantic, turning northward around Bermuda before
            being absorbed by an extratropical while situated southeast of Newfoundland. Irene persisted for 14 days as a
            tropical system, the longest duration of any storm of the 2005 season. It was the ninth named storm and fourth
            hurricane of the record-breaking season.

            Irene proved to be a difficult storm to forecast due to oscillations in strength. After almost dissipating on August 10,
            Irene peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on August 16 before being absorbed by a larger extratropical system late
            on August 18. Although there were initial fears of a landfall in the United States due to uncertainty in predicting
            the storm's track, Hurricane Irene never approached land and caused no recorded damage; however, swells up to
            8 ft (2.4 m) and strong rip currents resulted in one fatality in Long Beach, New York.
