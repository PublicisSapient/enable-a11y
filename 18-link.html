      <h2>Native HTML5</h2>

      <p>
        This paragraph has a few native
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a"
          >HTML5 links</a
        >
        in it. It is best to use native, non-ARIA links because they are
        guarenteed to be used in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator"
          >older browsers</a
        >
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget">other user agents</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This paragraph has a
        <a aria-current="page" href="18-link.html">self-referring link</a> (i.e.
        a page that links to itself). It is marked up with
        <code>aria-current="page"</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>Using ARIA</h2>

      <p>
        This paragraph has a few
        <span
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_link_role"
          tabindex="0"
          role="link"
          >ARIA link tags</span
        >
        in it. They are coded as <code>span</code> tags with the following
        attributes set:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>tabindex="0"</code> set (to make them keyboard accessible)
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>role="link"</code>, so that a screen reader reports them
          correctly.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In order for them to be functional, they need to have
        <span
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"
          tabindex="0"
          role="link"
          >JavaScript</span
        >
        added to them to make them functional. Feel free to use
        <span href="js/link.js" tabindex="0" role="link"
          >the script we use in this demo</span
        >
        if you need to use it.
