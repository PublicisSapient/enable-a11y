            This paragraph has a few native <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">HTML5 links</a> in it.
            It is best to use native, non-ARIA links because they are guarenteed to
            be used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator">older
            browsers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget">other user agents</a>.

            This paragraph has a few
            <span href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_link_role" tabindex="0" role="link">ARIA link tags</span>
            in it.  In order for them to be functional, they need to have 
            <span href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" tabindex="0" role="link">JavaScript</span>
            added to them to make them functional.  Feel free to use 
            <span href="js/link.js" tabindex="0" role="link">the script we use in this demo</span>
            if you need to use it.
