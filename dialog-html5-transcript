The first browser we are going to demonstrate is Safari using VoiceOver, which is built into OSX.
Right now, keyboard focus is on the link just before the button labeled "Log into our website", 
which will open the modal when pressed.

So, let's use the keyboard to navigate to the button ...

... and now we'll hit the enter key.

You may have noticed that when the dialog opened, the close button gains focus.
Also, note that the screen reader said "close this dialog, button".
This tells the screen reader user that focus is on a button labeled "close this dialog".
(Incidentally, this label was coded as alt attibute for the button's <img> tag).
You'll also note that the screen reader reports it is a web dialog.
That's  because the button is inside a HTML <dialog> tag.

VoiceOver would also announce this if the modal was coded as a <div> tag with its role attribute set to "dialog".
In fact, setting the role to dialog is what the polyfill does on all dialog tags so screen readers can report the dialog properly to the user.

Finally, you will notice the screen reader reads out the header, and the description in the dialog.
This happens because the <dialog> tag has its aria-labelledby attribute set to the id of the header, and its aria-describedby attribute set the the id of the description text.

Now, let's find out what happens when we tab past the end of the dialog.

You'll notice that when I hit the tab key after the "Confirm" button, focus goes to the first element in the dialog.
Focus never goes to any interactive element behind the modal.
For browsers that support the <dialog> tag, this automatically  happens because it is native browser behavior.
However, for browsers that don't, the polyfill steps in and uses focus events to implement this.
If focus goes outside the dialog, it loops back to the first element of the modal ... if we are tabbing forward, of course.
If we are tabbing backward, using a shift-TAB, then focus goes the last element of the modal.

And now, let's find out what happnes when I close the modal ...

... you'll notice that focus is placed back to the button that opened it.
Surprisingly, this is not default browser behavior, even though this is considered best practise in the WAI-ARIA documentation.  
It is added by a bit of code in the polyfill.  This code is executed for all browsers, including those with native support for the dialog tag.

Now let's look at Google Chrome using Android's built in screen reader, Talkback.

I am using a Samsung tablet for this demonstration, but the behavior for this device is, more or less, the same on any Android device using this software.

I'm going to start by navigating to the link just before the button that opens the modal.
Since this device doesn't have a keyboard, Talkback users must swipe left and right to navigate back and forth within the document.
You'll also note that it looks like focus is not just going to the interactive elements on the page (like the tab key does on a keyboard enabled device).
Instead, Talkback's so-called "accessibility focus" goes to all the items on the page that can be read.
This is default behavior for Talkback, and iOS's VoiceOver screen reader has similar behavior.
This can be changed, but I will leave that for a future video.
    
Now let's double tap to activate this button.

Again, you will notice that focus goes to the close button.
However, unlike VoiceOver, Talkback didn't read the dialog's heading or the description.
It also doesn't mention that you are now inside a web dialog.
This is because different screen readers don't support all the ARIA- attributes equally.
This is the reason why I chose "close this dialog" as the alt attribute for the close button image.
It tells the user that they are inside a dialog, even if a particular screen reader doesn't support the dialog role.
This is a good example that, just like in all aspects of web development, you should use progressive-enhancement to make your code bullet-proof.

Now, let's try to swipe backwards past the close button at the beginning of the dialog.

You'll notice that focus doesn't go behind the modal, just like when I was using a desktop screen reader.
However, this is not because of the focus events I described earlier.
The problem with most (if not all) mobile screen readers is that they don't fire focus and blur events back to the browser when swiping over the document.
In order to code this behavior on mobile, developers must set aria-hidden="true" to all elements outside of the modal dialog.
This may seem a little scary if you have a lot of interactive elements outside the dialog,
(I mean, who wants to set aria-hidden attributes on all of those DOM nodes).
However, this is an efficient algorithm to do this, and it's in the blog post that accompanies this video.
