<v The Shadow> Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.400
The Shadow knows!

<v Announcer> The Shadow, mysterious character who aids the forces of law and order,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.200
is in reality Lamont Cranston, wealthy young man of outstanding talent.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.400
As the shadow, Cranston is gifted with hypnotic power to cloud men's minds

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.720
so that they cannot see him. Cranston's friend and companion,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.800
the lovely Margo Lane, is the only person who knows to whom the voice of the

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.120
invisible Shadow belongs. Today's story: The Voice of Death.

<v Annie> Sam.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.633
<v Sam> Yes, Annie?

00:01:19.634 --> 00:01:22.080
<v Annie> You almost finished reading your paper?

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.149
<v Sam> Yes, Annie.

00:01:23.173 --> 00:01:25.088
<v Annie> Time to go to bed, ain't it?

00:01:25.112 --> 00:01:26.640
<v Sam> Yes, Annie.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.681
<v Annie> Better make sure all the
windows are shut. Sounds like a real mean storm
coming up.

00:01:31.705 --> 00:01:32.952
<v Sam> Yes, Annie.

00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:35.324

<v Annie> Sam.

00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:37.733
<v Sam> Yes, Annie.

00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:39.096
<v Annie> Did you hear
that?

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.503
<v Sam> What?

00:01:40.527 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Annie> You hear it?

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.088
Sounded just
like little kittens.

00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Sam> Yeah. Well, I
wonder where they come from.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Annie> Well, they're poor things, outdoors on a night like this.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.036
Sam, will you go out and
find them? Go on, will you?

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.880
<v Sam> Now, Annie, you don't...

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.120
<v Annie> Just listen to them little critters. Ain't you got no heart, Sam?

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.188
<v Sam> Oh, all right.
Where's my raincoat now?

00:02:02.212 --> 00:02:03.680
<v Annie> Oh, here you are.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.360
I'll set up a little box for them by the fire.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.640
<v Sam> All right, all right. Now stop your crying, kittens. I'm coming.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.093
<v Annie> Just wait. I'll heat up a bit of milk, too.

00:02:13.213 --> 00:02:16.006
<v Sam> Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty!!!

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.761
<v Annie> Do you see them, Sam?

00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:22.088
<v Sam> No, not yet ...  Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!  Annie, how do you ... ?

[Sounds of dogs madly growling and tearing something apart]

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Annie> Sam, what's wrong? What in the name of all this fooling?

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.401
Sam! Sam, what is it? Sam, what happened?

00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:34.880
[Sounds of dogs madly growling]

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.800
<v Annie> Sam, blood. You're all covered with blood.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.129
[Another man murmurs something inaudible quietly]

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:49.760
<v Annie> Sam, how could kittens do... Sam! He's dead.
