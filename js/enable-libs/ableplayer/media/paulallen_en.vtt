00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I put in 15 hours of work today

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and I'll work 17 tomorrow

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I hope someday to earn sufficient pay

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to buy my way out of this sorrow

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and meanwhile...

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Paul Allen owns an island

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Paul Allen owns a yacht

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I work every bit as hard as him

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and what have I got?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Paul Allen owns the Seahawks

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and the Sounders and the Blazers too

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
He pays those guys a billion dollars

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
just to play a game.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm gone before my wife and kids arise

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I get home after they've retired

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but that's the sacrifice I have to make

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
or else I'm likely to get fired

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and meanwhile...

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Paul Allen owns an island

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Paul Allen owns a 400-foot yacht

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I work every bit as hard as him

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and what have I got?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I got this song

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I got this song

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Yes I got this song

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Won't you sing along...

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Paul Allen owns an island

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Paul Allen owns a yacht

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I work every bit as hard as him

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and what have I got?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Paul Allen owns a museum

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Charges you and me 15 bucks a pop!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I work every bit as hard as him

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and what have I got?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I got this song

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Yes I got this song

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Yeah I got this song

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It's three minutes long.
