00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Michael K. Young> We are committed 
to the notion that

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.101
everyone should have an opportunity

00:00:07.101 --> 00:00:08.527
to participate in higher education,

00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:11.895
whether it be from the learning perspective 
or the research perspective

00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:14.931
or an opportunity to work here
at this institution.

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:19.369

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.557

00:00:23.307 --> 00:00:26.611
for our students,  our staff, and our faculty

00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:30.213
and we want to be sure 
if that talent has a disability

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:32.623
 that they know that we 
are a welcoming community.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.857

00:00:37.857 --> 00:00:43.115

00:00:47.577 --> 00:00:51.956
to join our community, regardless 
of their disabilities.

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:55.345
<v Narrator> Edward Ray,

00:00:55.345 --> 00:01:00.607

that excellence is achieved through diversity

00:01:00.607 --> 00:01:04.298
and that a commitment 
to equity and inclusion

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:06.604
really enriches each of our lives.
