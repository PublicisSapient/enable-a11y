00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.240
<v Michael K. Young> We are committed to the notion 
that everyone should have an opportunity

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.802
to participate in higher education,

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:06.302
whether it be from the learning perspective 
or the research perspective

00:00:06.302 --> 00:00:12.510
or an opportunity to work here
at this institution.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.773
<v Tracy Mitrano> We're a leading university globally.

00:00:14.773 --> 00:00:16.540
We want the best talent in the world

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.715
for our students, our staff, and our faculty

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:23.596
and we want to be sure 
if that talent has a disability

00:00:24.303 --> 00:00:26.387
that they know that we 
are a welcoming community.

00:00:26.387 --> 00:00:31.520
<v Pablo Molina> We're competing with other prestigious
and highly accomplished institutions. 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.924
We want to make sure that we can target
the right candidates

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:40.301
to join our community, 
regardless of their disabilities.

00:00:41.732 --> 00:00:44.951
<v Edward Ray> We genuinely believe that 
excellence is achieved through diversity

00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:48.648
and that a commitment 
to equity and inclusion

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:50.917
really enriches each of our lives.
