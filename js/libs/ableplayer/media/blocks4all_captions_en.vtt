[jaunty piano tune]

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.559
<v Boon's Mom> Boon, he's very excited
about the world.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.760
He's up for almost anything.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Boon's Dad> He's a thinker
and he likes to explore.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.680
He's not afraid to do things.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.200
<v Boon> I like computer programming.
I might do some computer programming.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.600
And I also want to be maybe an inventor,
a scientist, and an author.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Boon's mom> I don't know I guess if it's
so important for him to learn coding

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.990
but it's important I feel like for him
to be at least introduced to coding

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.220
and then it's his decision
to pursue it or not.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Richard Ladner> I'm Richard Ladner,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.540
professor emeritus at the
University of Washington.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.160
I've been observing, you know,
this movement

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.300
to bring computer science
into K-12 education.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.120
And I've noticed that a lot
of the technologies

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.480
that are being introduced
to young children are not accessible,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.840
especially for young children
who are blind or visually impaired.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Lauren Milne> I'm Lauren Milne.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.020
I'm a graduate student at
the University of Washington

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.800
and I'm the inventor
of Blocks4All.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.160
Traditionally, programming has been
done with text-based editing

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.880
so you just type in your program
which is of course very accessible

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.530
but more recently people have been
creating these environments for children,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.840
these block-based environments,
that have a lot of visual elements

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.700
so they're really not accessible
for a child with a visual impairment.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.580
We decided to design Blocks4All
on a touchscreen

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.600
because we found that a lot of children,
especially children with visual impairments,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.920
are already using touch screens.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.980
The screen reader VoiceOver that comes
with, for example, iPads,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.490
is very accessible.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.540
<v Richard> The outputs for the programs
were typically visual.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.840
There were animations, and
those weren't accessible either.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.920
Instead of having visual outputs
we have tactile output

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.200
which is using a robot.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Boon> Drive forward. Turn left.
Turn left. And then turn left again.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.500
[Screen reader voicing instructions]

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.240
<v Adults in the background> Here we go, Oh!

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.540
[blocks clattering]

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.439
<v Lauren> Really what I'm envisioning is
I see it as really a prototype

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.660
where I try out a whole bunch
of techniques

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.040
and I'm hoping that other developers

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.280
who are creating these
blocks-based environments

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.100
can use some of the techniques
that I'm finding

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.040
and make their own environments
accessible.
