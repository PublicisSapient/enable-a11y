WEBVTT

00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.069
<v Michael Young> We are committed to the notion
that everyone should have an opportunity

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:06.809
to participate in higher education

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.500
whether it be from the learning perspective
or the research perspective

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.200
or an opportunity to work here
at this institution.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:18.600
We benefit from that because we get
to enjoy the talents and the skills

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.000
of those people who come in
and also their perspective

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.640
which in many cases will be different
from the perspective of others on campus

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.100
so accessibility becomes a very
important value at the university.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.899
<v Tracy Mitrano> We're a
leading university globally.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.500
We want the best talent
in the world

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.300
for our students, our staff,
and our faculty

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.900
and we want to be sure
if that talent has a disability

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.400
that they know that we
are a welcoming  community.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.300
<v Pablo Molina> We are competing with other
prestigious and highly accomplished institutions.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.400
We want to make sure that we
can target the right candidates

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.000
to join our community regardless
of their disability status.

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.030
<v Edward Ray> In fact we genuinely believe that
excellence is achieved through diversity

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.830
and that a commitment
to equity and inclusion

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.070
really enriches each of our lives.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Michael Young> What the university
offers and makes available

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.200
has to be offered to everybody.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.200
We can't afford to waste the talents or the brilliance
or the minds of anybody

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.000
and making things accessible

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.500
allows everybody to engage in the university.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.000
<v Tracy Mitrano> Think about accommodation as really
the beginning of the conversation about disability.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.840
It was the appropriate measure that was
taken in the Americans with Disabilities Act

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.200
that was passed in 1990
and that's well over a generation ago.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.300
I think now we really
have to think less about

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.700
how we're going to measure

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.240
specifically this accommodation and
that accommodation

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.400
and recognize that we can make accessibility
open and available

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.450
so that individual staff,
faculty, or students

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.700
do not have to go
to get an accommodation.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.390
It will be automatically available

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.100
in the web page that they visit,
in the device that they use.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Gerry Hanley> The first
step really needs to be

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.000
an assessment of where we are

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.520
so we can then inform our planning
process,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.700
develop plans,
implement a project,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.700
and then really assess
the results of it.

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.589
<v Pablo Molinda> Key to our approach
to making sure that our campus

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.900
and our technology is accessible
to people with disabilities

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.700
is to ensure we do this by design.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.800
This is not an afterthought that we do
after we have implemented a new classroom.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.830
Instead this is something that we do from the
initial conception of a new project or idea.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.400
The same way we do this for
privacy and security

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.900
we do this for accessibility.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.100
<v Tracy Mitrano> A policy
really is an important way to go

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.380
because it will focus everyone's
attention.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.260
It's also probably the way that you have
to go now that there are legal pressures

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.800
on higher education in this area.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.200
The second thing I would say about policy is

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.400
there really are two types in general.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.300
One is a policy that you have
because you have a law.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.610
For example, the Family Education Rights
Privacy Act policy.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.850
So you want to be clear and sure

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.100
that you're going to have
compliance on your campus.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.480
There's another kind of policy
that I would call aspirational policy.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.500
And maybe accessibility
fits a little bit in both.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.000
But you most certainly can err
on the aspirational side.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.400
An aspirational policy is something
you establish for your institution

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.700
as a path moving toward something,
moving forward.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.100
It does not have to have
100 percent compliance

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.120
because it's really a direction that you're
setting strategically for your institution.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:03.290
<v Gerry Hanley> We begin with our vendors saying
a> this is not only important,

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.000
that this is required
for working with the CSU.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.100
Every student who comes
into our institution

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.200
we have to provide equally effective
access to those services

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.100
and you are a partner
in delivering those services to us.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.660
So we will tell you
what we need

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.500
and then we will help you
inform your staff, educate your staff,

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.700
provide them some consultation and guidance
in partnership with us

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.100
so you can deliver
the successful service for us.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Bruce Maas> If we go about things
in an ad hoc approach, one by one,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.300
we're not likely
to get the same results

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.700
as if we work together as a community
in higher education

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.400
to work with vendors
to improve accessibility for everyone

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.500
with regard to the products
that are offered.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.600
That's a much more pragmatic approach,
rather than institution by institution.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Gerry Hanley> Making accessibility a priority
in their development roadmap

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.200
is going to be driven
by the market demand

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.000
and if an institution
never says a word,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.800
the vendor isn't gonna
do anything about it.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.700
So if we begin to communicate
our demands collectively,

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.000
then the vendor will recognize
the market value of accessibility.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Michael Young> Accessibility requires effort
on the part of everyone

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.700
in the higher education community
- faculty, staff, technology vendors.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.100
If we all do our part,
our institutions can provide everyone

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.400
with an equal opportunity
to participate

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.120
and we all benefit from the
perspectives of a diverse group.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.500
<v Edward Ray> I would say to those out there
who are just getting started

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.400
or may be struggling to figure out
how to use technology

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.000
to advance accessibility
on their campuses that

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.140
there's no such thing
as a bad time to start.
