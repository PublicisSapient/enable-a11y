      <p>
        Whether you are new to accessibility or are a seasoned veteran, Enable's aim to <strong>teach devlopers how to
          make
          something accessible</strong> and to <strong>show why it is.</strong> Developers can walk through the code
        step
        by step to understand what HTML, CSS and JavaScript are needed to ensure their work "just works" for all users,
        no
        matter how they navigate the web.

      <h2 class="homepage__intro--header homepage__intro--header--existing">Add Accessible Code Quickly To Existing Projects</h2>

      <p>
        The Enable Accessibility Project follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1">First Rule of
          ARIA</a> when recommending code and encourages the use of native HTML5 functionality whenever possible (as
        long
        as browser accessibility support is there). However, since we know there are a lot of developers looking to make
        their existing custom widgets accessibile quickly due to time constraints, we also show custom code examples and
        what code features make them work with assistive technology.

      <h2 class="homepage__intro--header homepage__intro--header--npm">Use Pre-built Accessible Components</h2>

      <p>
        Enable also includes components that can be included into your own projects via NPM, with instructions how to
        integrate them as Webpack modules, native ES6 Modules or as old school ES4 JavaScript libraries. Accessible
        hamburger menus, carousels and mobile friendly skip links, are only a few examples of prebuilt code you can use
        in
        your projects today. We also encourage developers to consider contributing their own code to us for the benefit
        of
        the developer community at large.

    <ul>
      <li>
       We strive to keep our <strong>codebase up-to-date</strong>, with a <strong>focus on innovation</strong> (some of the examples have not appeared on any other site before).
      </li>
      <li>
        The components have been <strong>tested on mobile devices</strong> (a lot of
        other components forget
        that
        screen readers on mobile devices work slightly differently to their desktop
        cousins).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enable is focused on UX.</strong> It's goal is to help developers make an
        accessible web that is
        usable by everyone.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not only do we want to help developers, but <strong>we want the help from
          developers to contribute their
          accessible code.</strong>
        If you have an accessible component that you don't see here, please consider
        donating by raising a pull
        request.
