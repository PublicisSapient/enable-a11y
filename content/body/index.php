      <p>
        Whether you are new to accessibility or are a seasoned veteran, Enable's aim is to <strong>teach developers how to make something accessible</strong> and to <strong>show why it is.</strong> Developers can walk through the code step by step to understand what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are needed to ensure their work "just works" for all users, no matter how they navigate the web.

      <h2 class="homepage__intro--header homepage__intro--header--existing">Add Accessible Code Quickly To Existing
        Projects</h2>
      <p>
        The Enable Accessibility Project follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1">First Rule of ARIA</a> when recommending code and encourages the use of native HTML5 functionality whenever possible (as
        long as browser accessibility support is there). <!-- However, since we know there are a lot of developers looking to make
        their existing custom widgets accessible quickly due to time constraints, we also show custom code examples and
        what code features make them work with assistive technology. -->

      <p>
        Enable also includes components that can be included into your own projects via NPM, with instructions on how to
        integrate them as Webpack modules, native ES6 Modules or as old school ES4 JavaScript libraries.

  <h2 class="homepage__bottom-copy--heading homepage__intro--header homepage__intro--header--question">What Makes Enable Different?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We strive to keep our <strong>codebase up-to-date</strong>, with a <strong>focus on innovation</strong> (some of
      the examples have not appeared on any other site before).
    </li>
    <li>
      The components have been <strong>tested on mobile devices</strong> (a lot of
      other components forget
      that
      screen readers on mobile devices work slightly differently to their desktop
      cousins).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Enable is focused on UX.</strong> It's goal is to help developers make an
      accessible web that is
      usable by everyone.
    </li>
    <li>
      Not only do we want to help developers, but <strong>we want the help from developers to contribute their accessible code.</strong>
      If you have a component that you'd like to submit - please put in a <!-- #TODO --> <a href="https://github.com/PublicisSapient/enable-a11y?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing-code">PR</a>.
