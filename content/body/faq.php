  <dt>What is Enable?</dt>
  <dd>Enable is a place where developers can learn how to make accessible code. We show examples of different components
    that are accessible, and have code walkthroughs to show what makes them that way. If the component is sufficiently
    complex, we create an NPM modules of it so that developers can incorportate them in their own projects.</dd>

  <dt>Which components have NPM modules?</dt>
  <dd>If a component does have an NPM module in it, we mention it on the component's description page. Full instructions
    on how to install it are given at the bottom of the component's page as well.</dd>

  <dt>I have found a bug in one of the components! What should I do?</dt>
  <dd>Please let us know by going to the <a href="https://github.com/PublicisSapient/enable-a11y/issues">Enable Github
      issue page</a> and opening up a new issue. If you know how to fix it, please open up a pull request with the fix
    in it so we can review the fix. Please read <a
      href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork">the
      Github article about creating a pull request from a fork</a> for more information on how to do this.</dd>

  <dt>I have made an accessible component that is not in Enable! Can I donate it?</dt>
  <dd>Absolutely! Please send us a PR (see the previous comment). If you would like to discuss this with us first,
    please go to the <a href="https://github.com/PublicisSapient/enable-a11y/issues">Enable Github issue page</a> and
    opening up a new issue describing the code you would like to donate and a sample page on how it works.</dd>

  <dt>Do you have any advice on how I can add automated accessibility testing to my CI/CD pipeline?</dt>
  <dd>
    Enable uses a few tools to find the 20% to 50% of accessibility errors that can be captured by automated tools.  We also have
    started to do unit testing to ensure that accessibility features added to our components are not removed by accident.
    To understand more about what tools we use and how we have done this, please read our page on <a href="code-quality.php">   
      Accessible Code Quality
    </a>.
