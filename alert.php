                <li>
                    An assertive alert will be spoken immediately by a screen reader, and will
                    interrupt what the screen reader was saying at that moment. For example, if
                    the user tabs into a button and the screen reader is describing it, triggering
                    an asserive alert will interrupt that description in order
                    to give the alert to the user immediately.
                </li>
                <li>A polite alert will be spoken when the screenreader finishes what it
                    currently saying to the user. Using the same example above, if
                    the user tabs into a button and the screen reader is describing it,
                    a polite alert wait until it has finished describing that button before
                    saying the alert to the user.
                </li>
