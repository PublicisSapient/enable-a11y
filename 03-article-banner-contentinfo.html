            <h1>Hurricane Irene</h1>

            
            <p>Hurricane Irene was a long-lived Cape Verde hurricane Atlantic hurricane during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.
                The storm formed near Cape Verde on August 4 and crossed the Atlantic, turning northward around Bermuda before
                being absorbed by an extratropical while situated southeast of Newfoundland. Irene persisted for 14 days as a
                tropical system, the longest duration of any storm of the 2005 season. It was the ninth named storm and fourth
                hurricane of the record-breaking season.

                <h2>Fun Fact:</h2>

                <p>Irene was the name of my aunt who liked to cook up a storm when unexpected guests arrived at her house!</p>

            <p>
                Irene proved to be a difficult storm to forecast due to oscillations in strength. After almost dissipating on August 10,
                Irene peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on August 16 before being absorbed by a larger extratropical system late
                on August 18. Although there were initial fears of a landfall in the United States due to uncertainty in predicting
                the storm's track, Hurricane Irene never approached land and caused no recorded damage; however, swells up to
                8 ft (2.4 m) and strong rip currents resulted in one fatality in Long Beach, New York.
