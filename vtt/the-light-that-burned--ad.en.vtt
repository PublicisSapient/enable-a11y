00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.840
 Tobor lurks around a corner of the building.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.480
 A car slowly approaches the building.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.500
 The car stops, and a woman steps out of the rear door.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.260
 As the woman enters the building, the detective transforms into Ape Man, the crime-fighting robot.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.800
 In the next scene, the mysterious woman steps out of the elevator on the 8th floor.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:07.200
 She walks down the hall with determination until she gets to room 811, and then knocks gently on the door.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.040
 An automatic door slides open slowly.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.360
 A creepy bald man replies.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560
 The man is wearing a suit and smoking a cigar.
