00:01.000 --> 00:07.605
In this video, I will be demonstrating how to create an
accessible modal dialog using the HTML5 dialog tag.

2
00:07.854 --> 00:11.603
It uses a polyfill for browsers
that don't support it yet natively.

3
00:11.644 --> 00:15.894
For details on the
polyfill and more information on how this demo was
built,

4
00:15.895 --> 00:21.146
please checkout the video's accompanying
blog post on useragentman.com.

5
00:21.897 --> 00:26.645
The first browser we are going to demonstrate is
Safari using VoiceOver, which is built into OSX.

6
00:27.146 --> 00:33.143
Right now, keyboard focus is on the link just
before the button labeled "Log in to our website",

7
00:33.144 --> 00:35.395
which will open the modal when pressed.

8
00:35.396 --> 00:38.646
So, let's use the keyboard to
navigate to the button...

9
00:38.647 --> 00:41.396
[VoiceOver says: Log in to our website, button, main, two items]

10
00:41.644 --> 00:43.894
and now we'll hit the enter key.

11
00:43.918 --> 00:49.146
[VoiceOver says: Close this dialog, web dialog, login, 1 item. In order to continue, please log into the application.]

12
00:49.147 --> 00:53.646
You may have noticed that when the dialog
opened, the close button gains focus.

13
00:53.647 --> 00:58.142
Also, note that the screen reader
said "close this dialog, button".

14
00:58.143 --> 01:03.394
This tells the screen reader user that focus
is on a button labeled "close this dialog".

15
01:04.500 --> 01:10.528
(Incidentally, this label was coded as
alt attribute for the button's  tag).

16
01:09.424 --> 01:14.395
You'll also note that the screen
reader reports it is a web dialog.

17
01:14.396 --> 01:17.895
That's because the button is
inside a HTML  tag.

18
01:18.000 --> 01:25.249
VoiceOver would also announce this if the modal was coded as a  tag with its role attribute set to "dialog".

19
01:25.146 --> 01:33.146
In fact, setting the role to dialog is what the polyfill does on all  dialog tags so screen readers can report the dialog properly to the user.

20
01:33.650 --> 01:39.143
Finally, you will notice the screen reader reads
out the header, and the description in the dialog.

21
01:39.144 --> 01:44.453
This happens because the  tag has its
aria-labelledby attribute set to the id of the header,

22
01:44.478 --> 01:49.666
and its aria-describedby attribute
set the id of the description text.

23
01:50.269 --> 01:56.020
Now, let's find out what happens when
we tab past the end of the dialog.

24
01:56.520 --> 01:58.226
[VoiceOver: Username, edit text with autofill menu.]

25
01:58.227 --> 02:00.480
[Password, secure edit text with...]

26
02:00.481 --> 02:01.729
[Cancel, button.]

27
02:01.730 --> 02:03.479
[Confirm, button.]

28
02:03.503 --> 02:05.726
[Close this dialog, button.]

29
02:05.727 --> 02:12.475
You'll notice that when I hit the tab key after the "Confirm" button, focus goes to the first element in the dialog.

30
02:12.476 --> 02:16.227
Focus never goes to any interactive
element behind the modal.

31
02:16.228 --> 02:22.228
For browsers that support the  tag, this
automatically happens because it is native browser behavior.

32
02:22.229 --> 02:29.229
However, for browsers that don't, the polyfill
steps in and uses focus events to implement this.

33
02:29.230 --> 02:33.727
If focus goes outside the dialog,
it loops back to the first element of the modal...

34
02:33.728 --> 02:36.476
if we are tabbing forward, of course.

35
02:36.477 --> 02:41.728
If we are tabbing backward, using a shift-TAB,
then focus goes the last element of the modal.

36
02:41.729 --> 02:45.727
And now, let's find out what
happens when I close the modal...

37
02:45.751 --> 02:48.476
[VoiceOver: Login in to our website, button, main, 2 items.]

38
02:48.477 --> 02:51.232
You'll notice that focus is placed
back to the button that opened it.

39
02:51.233 --> 02:58.977
Surprisingly, this is not default browser behavior, even though this is considered best practice in the WAI-ARIA documentation.

40
02:58.978 --> 03:01.517
It is added by a bit of code in the
polyfill.

41
03:01.518 --> 03:06.769
This code is executed for all browsers, including those with native support for the dialog tag.

42
03:06.770 --> 03:14.268
Now let's look at Google Chrome using
Android's built in screen reader, Talkback.

43
03:14.269 --> 03:22.269
I am using a Samsung tablet for this demonstration, but the behavior for this  device is, more or less, the same on any Android device using this software.

44
03:24.526 --> 03:28.520
I'm going to start by navigating to the link
just before the button that opens the modal.

45
03:28.770 --> 03:36.521
Since this device doesn't have a keyboard, Talkback users must swipe left and right to navigate back and forth within the document.

46
03:36.522 --> 03:43.517
[(Talkback says short beginnings of dialog while user swipes through text)]

47
03:43.522 --> 03:48.771
[Talkback: Creating Accessible HTML5 Modal Dialogs for Desktop and Modal, link.]

48
03:48.772 --> 03:53.023
[Log in to our website, button, out of list.]

49
03:53.024 --> 04:01.024
You'll also note that it looks like focus is not just going to the interactive elements on the page (like the tab key does on a keyboard enabled device).

50
04:03.018 --> 04:10.019
Instead, Talkback's so-called "accessibility focus"
goes to all the items on the page that can be read.

51
04:10.020 --> 04:16.516
This is default behavior for Talkback, and iOS's
VoiceOver screen reader has similar behavior.

52
04:16.517 --> 04:20.019
This can be changed, but I will
leave that for a future video.

53
04:20.019 --> 04:23.023
Now let's double tap to
activate this button.

54
04:23.024 --> 04:27.268
[Talkback: Close this dialog, button. Double-tap to activate.]

55
04:29.521 --> 04:32.272
Again, you will notice that
focus goes to the close button.

56
04:32.273 --> 04:37.520
However, unlike VoiceOver, Talkback didn't
read the dialog's heading or the description.

57
04:37.521 --> 04:41.021
It also doesn't mention that you
are now inside a web dialog.

58
04:41.185 --> 04:45.437
This is because different screen readers don't
support all the ARIA-attributes equally.

59
04:45.438 --> 04:51.933
This is the reason why I chose "close this dialog"
as the alt attribute for the close button image.

60
04:51.934 --> 04:57.940
It tells the user that they are inside a dialog, even if a
particular screen reader doesn't support the dialog role.

61
04:57.941 --> 05:05.941
This is a good example that, just like in all aspects of web development, you should use progressive-enhancement to make your code bullet-proof.

62
05:06.936 --> 05:11.938
Now, let's try to swipe backwards past the
close button at the beginning of the dialog.

63
05:11.962 --> 05:18.436
[Talkback says: Creating An Accessible Dialog Using the HTML5 Dialog Tag, web view.]

64
05:18.437 --> 05:23.934
You'll notice that focus doesn't go behind the modal,
just like when I was using a desktop screen reader.

65
05:23.935 --> 05:28.436
However, this is not because of the
focus events I described earlier.

66
05:28.437 --> 05:36.437
The problem with most (if not all) mobile screen readers is that they don't fire focus and blur events back to the browser when swiping over the document.

67
05:36.686 --> 05:44.686
In order to code this behavior on mobile, developers must set aria-hidden= "true" to all elements outside of the modal dialog.

68
05:45.187 --> 05:49.934
This may seem a little scary if you have a lot
of interactive elements outside the dialog,

69
05:49.935 --> 05:55.186
I mean, who wants to set aria-hidden
attributes on all of those DOM nodes?

70
05:55.187 --> 06:00.684
However, this is an efficient algorithm to do this, and
it's in the blog post that accompanies this video.

71
06:00.685 --> 06:07.185

06:07.186 --> 06:12.185
Hope this demonstration was helpful! Please
feel free to comment on the my YouTube page,
