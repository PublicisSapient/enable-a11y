00:00:01.392 --> 00:00:01.498
Scene is of a young man with a goatee and looking at the viewer from his living room.  The footage seems to be taken with a 1990s webcam.

00:00:05.073 --> 00:00:05.213
He becomes wild-eyed and starts to theatrically wave his computer microphone around.

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:15.135
He escalates his antics and starts waving his other hand in along with the microphone in his other hand.

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:17.502
For some strange reason, he starts singing nonsense into the microphone.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.707
He starts inexplicably hitting himself with the microphone.

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:25.860
He sticks the microphone deeply up his nose and starts singing again while banging his head up and down.  The microphone is hanging and swinging violently from his nostril.
