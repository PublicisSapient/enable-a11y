00:00.000 --> 00:04.840
 Good afternoon and bonjour à tous. We will start with the latest numbers on

2
00:04.840 --> 00:16.560
 COVID-19 in Canada. There are now 79,491 cases including 5,955 deaths and 40,342

3
00:16.560 --> 00:25.760
 or 51% have now recovered. Labs across Canada have tested over 1,372,000

4
00:25.760 --> 00:32.920
 people for testing and to date with about 5% of these testing positive

5
00:32.920 --> 00:41.440
 overall and we're now testing an average of 28,000 or so people a day. These

6
00:41.440 --> 00:46.720
 numbers change quickly and are updated regularly on Canada.ca/coronavirus.

7
00:46.720 --> 00:53.520
 As Canada's COVID-19 epidemic continues to slow and provinces and territories

8
00:53.520 --> 00:57.760
 proceed with careful reopening plans, we are thinking more and more about how to

9
00:57.760 --> 01:02.320
 proceed through the spring and summer months and what to plan for in the fall.

10
01:02.320 --> 01:07.440
 Vigilance and patience will be our biggest virtues during this time. Until

11
01:07.440 --> 01:12.160
 effective therapies or a vaccine is widely available, our aim must be to

12
01:12.160 --> 01:16.520
 carefully balance the direct risks associated with COVID-19 epidemic

13
01:16.520 --> 01:21.880
 activity with the unintended health, social and economic consequences. That

14
01:21.880 --> 01:25.720
 means reopening to lessen negative consequences while maintaining core

15
01:25.720 --> 01:31.640
 public health practices to keep COVID-19 activity to a low level. For the spring

16
01:31.640 --> 01:35.800
 and summer months, strict adherence to the public health basics of physical

17
01:35.800 --> 01:39.940
 distancing, hand-washing and cough etiquette must continue as the bare

18
01:39.940 --> 01:45.160
 minimum. In addition, where COVID-19 activity is occurring, use of non-medical

19
01:45.160 --> 01:49.840
 masks or face coverings is recommended as an added layer of protection when

20
01:49.840 --> 01:53.840
 physical distancing is difficult to maintain. And staying home when sick is a

21
01:53.840 --> 01:59.240
 must, always and everywhere. We will be posting updated Federal Provincial

22
01:59.240 --> 02:04.720
 Territorial Special Advisory Committee on COVID-19's recommendation on the

23
02:04.720 --> 02:11.360
 non-medical masks today. If we can all maintain these measures to the best of

24
02:11.360 --> 02:16.200
 our ability, we stand the best chance of keeping COVID-19 activity down through

25
02:16.200 --> 02:20.560
 the spring and summer. This will give us more lead time to work on full range of

26
02:20.560 --> 02:24.680
 preparedness activities and readiness for whatever may come this fall and

27
02:24.680 --> 02:29.080
 winter. As well, suppressing disease activity throughout the summer will

28
02:29.080 --> 02:33.400
 continue to buy time for research and innovation on medical therapies and

29
02:33.400 --> 02:37.800
 vaccine development. I know this may not be the grand reopening we might have

30
02:37.800 --> 02:42.320
 liked, but we won't get through this on hope alone. For the weeks and months

31
02:42.320 --> 02:47.360
 ahead, we'll need to continue to prop each other up with creativity, kindness,

32
02:47.360 --> 02:52.480
 and patience. When it comes to summer reopening, keeping our two meters is a

33
02:52.480 --> 02:57.440
 must. Outside spaces are better than inside. Small bubbles of core contacts

34
02:57.440 --> 03:01.760
 are better than big. And good hand-washing is the right accessory for

35
03:01.760 --> 03:06.360
 all venues and occasions. Thank you. Merci.

36
03:06.360 --> 03:11.920
 Bonjour. Comme d'habitude, je vais commencer par les derniers chiffres concernant la

37
03:11.920 --> 03:25.080
 COVID-19 au Canada. Il y a maintenant 79 491 cas, donc 5957 décès et 40 342

38
03:25.080 --> 03:31.600
 rétablissements, ce qui correspond à 51% des cas. À ce jour, les laboratoires

39
03:31.600 --> 03:36.760
 l'échelle du Canada ont analysé les tests pour la COVID-19 de plus de 1

40
03:36.760 --> 03:44.240
 million 372 mille personnes et environ 5% des tests effectués se sont révélés

41
03:44.240 --> 03:50.680
 positifs. En moyenne, nous testons actuellement environ 28 000 personnes par

42
03:50.680 --> 03:56.380
 jour. Ces chiffres évoluent rapidement et se sont régulièrement mis à jour sur les

43
03:56.380 --> 04:04.460
 sites Canada.ca/le-coronavirus. À mesure que l'épidémie de COVID-19 au

44
04:04.460 --> 04:09.120
 Canada continue de ralentir et que les provinces et les territoires mettent en

45
04:09.120 --> 04:14.360
 oeuvre les plans d'ouverture réfléchie, nous nous penchons davantage sur la

46
04:14.360 --> 04:19.520
 façon de procéder au printemps et à l'été et sur les plans pour l'automne.

47
04:19.520 --> 04:24.680
 La vigilance et la patience seront nos plus grandes vertus pendant cette

48
04:24.680 --> 04:28.040
 période. Jusqu'à ce qu'un vaccin ou un

49
04:28.040 --> 04:31.400
 traitement efficace soit largement accessible,

50
04:31.400 --> 04:36.460
 notre objectif doit être d'assurer un équilibre délicat entre les risques

51
04:36.460 --> 04:41.000
 directs associés à l'activité épidémique de la COVID-19 et les

52
04:41.000 --> 04:45.540
 conséquences sanitaires, sociales et économiques inattendues.

53
04:45.540 --> 04:50.200
 Cela signifie une reprise des activités pour atténuer les conséquences

54
04:50.200 --> 04:55.300
 négatives tout en continuant d'appliquer les pratiques de santé publique de base

55
04:55.300 --> 05:01.780
 pour maintenir l'activité relative à la COVID-19 à un faible niveau. Au printemps

56
05:01.780 --> 05:07.060
 et à l'été, il faudra continuer au strict minimum de suivre à la lettre les

57
05:07.060 --> 05:12.500
 principes de base de la santé publique, à savoir la distanciation physique, le

58
05:12.500 --> 05:18.640
 lavage des mains et les règles d'hygiène respiratoire. En outre, en cas d'activité

59
05:18.640 --> 05:23.620
 relative à la COVID-19, le port d'un masque non-médical ou d'un

60
05:23.620 --> 05:28.280
 couvre-visage est recommandé comme mesure de protection supplémentaire

61
05:28.280 --> 05:32.580
 lorsqu'il est difficile de maintenir la distanciation physique.

62
05:32.580 --> 05:38.380
 On va publier les recommandations du comité consultatif spécial aujourd'hui.

63
05:38.380 --> 05:43.700
 Et rester à la maison lorsqu'on est malade est essentiel en tout temps,

64
05:43.700 --> 05:49.060
 peu importe où l'on se trouve. Si nous pouvons tous maintenir ces mesures au

65
05:49.060 --> 05:53.780
 milieu de nos capacités, nous maximisons les chances de limiter l'activité

66
05:53.780 --> 05:59.620
 relative à la COVID-19 au printemps et à l'été. Nous aurons ainsi plus de temps pour

67
05:59.620 --> 06:04.700
 travailler à un vaste éventail d'activités de préparation en prévision

68
06:04.700 --> 06:11.300
 de ce qui pourrait arriver cet automne et cet hiver. De plus, supprimer l'activité

69
06:11.300 --> 06:16.100
 de la maladie pendant l'été nous permettra de continuer de gagner pour

70
06:16.100 --> 06:20.260
 faire progresser la recherche et l'innovation sur les traitements médicaux

71
06:20.260 --> 06:25.940
 et la mise au point d'un vaccin. Nous sommes conscients que ce n'est pas la

72
06:25.940 --> 06:32.020
 grande reprise des activités que nous aurions souhaitées, mais l'espoir seul ne

73
06:32.020 --> 06:36.820
 nous permettra pas de sortir de cette crise. Au cours des semaines et des mois

74
06:36.820 --> 06:42.380
 à venir, nous devrons continuer de nous soutenir avec créativité, bienveillance

75
06:42.380 --> 06:48.100
 et patience. En ce qui concerne la reprise des activités estivales, le

76
06:48.100 --> 06:53.260
 maintien d'une distance de deux mètres est essentiel. Il vaut mieux se

77
06:53.260 --> 06:58.740
 trouver à l'extérieur qu'à l'intérieur. Il est préférable d'entretenir des

78
06:58.740 --> 07:03.700
 petits cercles sociaux plutôt que des grands et un bon lavage de main, et la

79
07:03.700 --> 07:07.140
 chose à faire en tout temps. Merci.

80
07:07.140 --> 07:11.220
 Thank you, doctors. We will now open the telephone line in the floor to questions.

81
07:11.220 --> 07:14.260
 Vous pouvez poser vos questions dans les deux langues officielles. Nous vous

82
07:14.260 --> 07:19.780
 demandons de vous limiter à une question et une question de suivi. For those who

83
07:19.780 --> 07:23.740
 wish to ask a question in the room, please make your way over to the freely

84
07:23.740 --> 07:29.060
 standing mic. We will start on the phone as usual. Over to you, operator.

85
07:29.060 --> 07:35.660
 Merci. Thank you. The next question is from Alina Dib. Please go ahead with

86
07:35.660 --> 07:37.140
 your line, it's open.

87
07:37.140 --> 07:55.660
 Yes, hello. Dr. New, I would like you to explain to me, what is the difference between what you are saying now, recommending wearing a non-medical mask or a face mask, and what you were saying until now about the mask. I don't quite understand the nuance. Could you explain it to me?

88
07:55.660 --> 07:58.260
 Thank you for the question.

89
07:58.260 --> 08:05.960
 Indeed, there are not really many differences, not at all, from what Dr. Time and I have already seen.

90
08:05.960 --> 08:17.860
 We continue our discussions with our provincial and territorial counterparts, and with the evolution of science, we say that this is an additional measure.

91
08:17.860 --> 08:28.360
 As we have said several times, we must always be aware of the medical-caliber masks for health care workers on the ground.

92
08:28.360 --> 08:41.160
 But for the general public, if we are in circumstances where it is not possible to keep a physical distance of two meters, this is an additional measure.

93
08:41.160 --> 08:51.160
 But it also depends on the circumstances, because epidemiology varies from one region to another.

94
08:51.160 --> 09:01.860
 It is certain that if we use public transport in Montreal, it is a completely different situation compared to maybe in the north, in the Yukon Territory.

95
09:01.860 --> 09:03.660
 Thank you.

96
09:03.660 --> 09:13.660
 Okay, so maybe my next one would be for you, Dr. Tim. So what exactly has changed for you now to say, "We recommend"?

97
09:13.660 --> 09:21.160
 Because you were saying that the mask does not protect the person that was wearing it. I am assuming that this is still the case.

98
09:21.160 --> 09:31.660
 So what has changed for you now to go the extra step and not just say, "This is a good idea. This can be done. Now it is. We recommend that you do this"?

99
09:31.660 --> 09:40.660
 Yes, so that is a specific recommendation, if you like. I think the previous language was more permissive.

100
09:40.660 --> 09:53.660
 So I think, just to rewind a little bit, the chief medical officer's position from the start was that, of course, these masks protect others.

101
09:53.660 --> 09:58.660
 So if you are wearing it, you are protecting other people against your droplets.

102
09:58.660 --> 10:04.660
 So at the start, it was obviously someone who is sick, who is coughing or sneezing.

103
10:04.660 --> 10:13.660
 If they are going to go out or have to go to a medical appointment, for example, they need to cover the cough with facial covering or mask.

104
10:13.660 --> 10:15.660
 That is for the sick person.

105
10:15.660 --> 10:27.660
 So it is when we got more evidence about asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and that although we don't fully understand their role in transmission,

106
10:27.660 --> 10:36.660
 it is an added layer of protection, even for people who don't have symptoms, to wear a mask to prevent transmission to others.

107
10:36.660 --> 10:46.660
 Even though the evidence base hasn't changed too much, and particularly as people have generally been staying at home,

108
10:46.660 --> 10:53.660
 and now that we are sort of reopening or restarting a lot of the activities,

109
10:53.660 --> 11:02.660
 the chief medical officers felt that they can recommend this for people who cannot maintain that two-meter distance.

110
11:02.660 --> 11:12.660
 And more specifically, of course, if there has been community transmission in your jurisdiction.

111
11:12.660 --> 11:19.660
 And as Dr. New said, jurisdictions felt that they need to do that risk assessment

112
11:19.660 --> 11:24.660
 because there are some provinces and territories that haven't had community transmission

113
11:24.660 --> 11:30.660
 and others clearly have and continue to have community transmission activities.

114
11:30.660 --> 11:37.660
 So they will do their individual risk assessments in terms of the very specific recommendations locally.

115
11:37.660 --> 11:41.660
 But I think from our perspective, it is an added layer of protection.

116
11:41.660 --> 11:44.660
 It is for you to protect others.

117
11:44.660 --> 11:48.660
 So if two people are wearing masks, I'm protecting you and you're protecting me.

118
11:48.660 --> 11:55.660
 And so I think as more people do go out in the community, you can imagine there'll be more people on public transport

119
11:55.660 --> 12:02.660
 or maybe more people -- some of the retail stores are beginning to open, for example.

120
12:02.660 --> 12:05.660
 And if you can't predict whether you can maintain that two-meter distance,

121
12:05.660 --> 12:11.660
 then it's recommended that you wear the non-medical mask or facial covering.

122
12:11.660 --> 12:16.660
 Merci, doctor. Next question, operator.

123
12:16.660 --> 12:18.660
 Merci. Thank you.

124
12:18.660 --> 12:26.660
 Our next question is from Mike Blanchfield from the Canadian Press. Please go ahead.

125
12:26.660 --> 12:30.660
 Hi. I guess this is a question for Dr. Tam.

126
12:30.660 --> 12:38.660
 We've seen radically different approaches in the provinces, two largest provinces, Ontario and Quebec, on reopening,

127
12:38.660 --> 12:43.660
 especially when it comes to schooling, and we heard what Doug Ford said yesterday.

128
12:43.660 --> 12:48.660
 How do you explain the differences in approach to reopening, easing of restrictions,

129
12:48.660 --> 12:56.660
 in these two highly afflicted, Canada's two largest provinces?

130
12:56.660 --> 13:02.660
 So at the federal level, I'm working with the province territories, essentially the chief medical officers.

131
13:02.660 --> 13:06.660
 We have provided guidance and criteria.

132
13:06.660 --> 13:14.660
 Obviously, the provinces want to retain their own ability to adjust their approaches.

133
13:14.660 --> 13:24.660
 I think even in the global context, I don't know that there's an absolute white pathway down this curve.

134
13:24.660 --> 13:29.660
 As I've said, people have to do whatever they do cautiously and slowly,

135
13:29.660 --> 13:34.660
 using the best information they have in their own particular context,

136
13:34.660 --> 13:42.660
 and that if they were reopening or loosening certain measures,

137
13:42.660 --> 13:50.660
 they need to have the necessary systems to detect whether that has led to any increase in cases or clusters.

138
13:50.660 --> 14:00.660
 So I think whatever pathway down this curve, there is no one-size-fits-all, and there is a certain element of uncertainty.

139
14:00.660 --> 14:11.660
 But if you do it more cautiously and monitor it and adjust as needed, that is the key principle.

140
14:11.660 --> 14:14.660
 Thank you. Follow-up?

141
14:14.660 --> 14:17.660
 All right. Well, how do you square the differences anyway?

142
14:17.660 --> 14:22.660
 I mean, they're two very similar provinces, similar sets of circumstances.

143
14:22.660 --> 14:31.660
 Does it surprise you from a scientific point of view that two extremely different conclusions can be reached under these circumstances?

144
14:31.660 --> 14:44.660
 Well, I think as the local jurisdictions, one aspect which I'm not sure is particularly evident is that I think public health is also trying to take a holistic approach,

145
14:44.660 --> 14:53.660
 not just balancing the sort of effective public health measures, but also looking at the negative consequences as well.

146
14:53.660 --> 14:55.660
 You need to have some balance.

147
14:55.660 --> 15:02.660
 You need to bring back certain activities and certain measures, getting people outside, for instance.

148
15:02.660 --> 15:08.660
 The outside is less risk because we know transmission generally occurs,

149
15:08.660 --> 15:12.660
 and particularly transmission to large numbers of people occurs indoors.

150
15:12.660 --> 15:16.660
 And so I think all of those have to be taken into account.

151
15:16.660 --> 15:23.660
 But in some areas, there may be a good reason why certain things are being opened,

152
15:23.660 --> 15:28.660
 and in order to support the community in their local context as well.

153
15:28.660 --> 15:38.660
 And there's a balance between the need to reduce the spread of disease compared to all the other needs from a health, social, and economic perspective.

154
15:38.660 --> 15:42.660
 Yes, Dr. Njoo, I just would add that even within a province, you can see the differences,

155
15:42.660 --> 15:47.660
 because obviously the provincial authorities know more what's happening on the ground than Dr. Tam and myself.

156
15:47.660 --> 15:50.660
 They have the data. They know what's actually happening on the ground.

157
15:50.660 --> 15:55.660
 And so we can see in the province of Quebec that what's happening on the island of Montreal

158
15:55.660 --> 16:01.660
 and how they may be relaxing their measures, you know, maybe in a slower fashion,

159
16:01.660 --> 16:05.660
 based on the epidemiology of what's happening in Montreal as compared to the rest of the province of Quebec.

160
16:05.660 --> 16:10.660
 That's a prime example that even within a province that there needs to be a careful look at

161
16:10.660 --> 16:15.660
 obviously taking into account what's happening locally to make the best possible decisions

162
16:15.660 --> 16:18.660
 based on what they know in terms of the epidemiology.

163
16:18.660 --> 16:19.660
 Thank you.

164
16:19.660 --> 16:21.660
 &gt;&gt;Brad Ross: Thank you. Operator, next question.

165
16:21.660 --> 16:28.660
 &gt;&gt;Operator: Thank you. Merci. La prochaine question, Marie Vastelle-Le Devoir. La parole est à vous.

166
16:28.660 --> 16:32.660
 &gt;&gt;Marie Vastelle-Le Devoir. Hi, Dr. Tam. My question is for you.

167
16:32.660 --> 16:36.660
 I think I have an idea of the answer, but I would like to hear you explain

168
16:36.660 --> 16:40.660
 why is your recommendation today on non-surgical masks,

169
16:40.660 --> 16:46.660
 why is it only a recommendation and why are you not making it mandatory Canada-wide

170
16:46.660 --> 16:49.660
 to wear a mask when we go outside?

171
16:49.660 --> 16:51.660
 Is it a question of jurisdiction?

172
16:51.660 --> 16:56.660
 Is it a question of there just wouldn't be enough masks to make it mandatory?

173
16:56.660 --> 16:58.660
 Is it a question of rights?

174
16:58.660 --> 17:02.660
 Can you explain why it remains only a recommendation?

175
17:02.660 --> 17:05.660
 &gt;&gt;Dr. Tam: So at the national level, it remains a recommendation

176
17:05.660 --> 17:11.660
 and as the medical officers of health needs to look at their own particular context

177
17:11.660 --> 17:15.660
 in terms of whether they actually have evidence of community transmission

178
17:15.660 --> 17:20.660
 and some areas actually don't and have actually never had community transmission.

179
17:20.660 --> 17:27.660
 It's very different from, say, maybe as Dr. News are comparing Montreal and Toronto

180
17:27.660 --> 17:32.660
 to Yukon or the PEI might actually be very different.

181
17:32.660 --> 17:36.660
 So they need that ability to make those recommendations.

182
17:36.660 --> 17:41.660
 Their public transportation systems might be different, for example,

183
17:41.660 --> 17:45.660
 and so they need the ability to do that risk assessment

184
17:45.660 --> 17:49.660
 and recommend it from their perspective.

185
17:49.660 --> 17:53.660
 From the federal perspective, Transport Canada, of course,

186
17:53.660 --> 18:01.660
 given that's their federal jurisdiction, did make the wearing of non-medical mask

187
18:01.660 --> 18:04.660
 mandatory on those conveyances.

188
18:04.660 --> 18:08.660
 So that is within the federal jurisdiction.

189
18:08.660 --> 18:12.660
 &gt;&gt;And, Dr. New, maybe I'll just add, certainly understand the interest

190
18:12.660 --> 18:15.660
 in terms of the use of a non-medical mask by the general public,

191
18:15.660 --> 18:19.660
 but one of the issues we're also obviously with our counterparts

192
18:19.660 --> 18:23.660
 in provinces and territories looking at closely is that the unintended consequences

193
18:23.660 --> 18:27.660
 where if people think that by wearing a mask in public,

194
18:27.660 --> 18:30.660
 they don't need to follow all of the other important public health measures

195
18:30.660 --> 18:34.660
 that we've been underlining so many times in terms of guarding, you know,

196
18:34.660 --> 18:37.660
 the physical distancing of two meters, et cetera.

197
18:37.660 --> 18:40.660
 So that's one of the things I think we still need to underline,

198
18:40.660 --> 18:44.660
 that this is a supplementary measure that people can use to protect themselves

199
18:44.660 --> 18:47.660
 when it's difficult to maintain that physical distancing of two meters,

200
18:47.660 --> 18:51.660
 but it certainly does not replace all of the other good measures

201
18:51.660 --> 18:53.660
 such as hand washing, et cetera.

202
18:53.660 --> 18:56.660
 Thank you.

203
18:56.660 --> 19:00.660
 &gt;&gt;Thanks, and as a follow-up, sorry, there's an echo.

204
19:00.660 --> 19:04.660
 As a follow-up, Dr. Tam, so as you mentioned previously,

205
19:04.660 --> 19:08.660
 it was already suggested to wear a non-medical mask when we go outside.

206
19:08.660 --> 19:12.660
 Now it's recommended, but in places like Quebec, for example,

207
19:12.660 --> 19:16.660
 it has been recommended, strongly recommended, for a week already.

208
19:16.660 --> 19:21.660
 And we see that people are not necessarily wearing it outside at the grocery store

209
19:21.660 --> 19:25.660
 or in other locations where they can't social distance.

210
19:25.660 --> 19:29.660
 So what exactly can you do as public health officials

211
19:29.660 --> 19:33.660
 to ensure that something actually changes on the ground?

212
19:33.660 --> 19:39.660
 Your language is changing, but people aren't wearing it more.

213
19:39.660 --> 19:42.660
 &gt;&gt;I can't speak to the very local jurisdiction,

214
19:42.660 --> 19:47.660
 and they will adjust their approach as needed.

215
19:47.660 --> 19:53.660
 But I think from certain public opinion research, et cetera,

216
19:53.660 --> 19:56.660
 Canadians are wearing more masks,

217
19:56.660 --> 20:02.660
 and they are more -- the social, cultural shift is beginning to occur.

218
20:02.660 --> 20:05.660
 So part of what public health is doing is --

219
20:05.660 --> 20:12.660
 the concept is one, I think, of reciprocal protection.

220
20:12.660 --> 20:18.660
 So I think for Canadians, thinking of it as I'm protecting you

221
20:18.660 --> 20:22.660
 and you're protecting me is a very key concept.

222
20:22.660 --> 20:26.660
 We have to gain the trust of the Canadian public

223
20:26.660 --> 20:31.660
 and get their buy-in to do all of this.

224
20:31.660 --> 20:37.660
 Mandating is one measure, which some jurisdictions might take if they have to.

225
20:37.660 --> 20:44.660
 But for the most part, I do think that the shift is occurring in the population as well,

226
20:44.660 --> 20:47.660
 which I think is great.

227
20:47.660 --> 20:50.660
 &gt;&gt;Thank you, Doctor. We'll now turn to the room. First question.

228
20:50.660 --> 20:53.660
 &gt;&gt;Yeah. Hi, Dr. Tam. It's Ryan Templeton with the National Post.

229
20:53.660 --> 20:58.660
 The Pan-Canadian Public Health Care Network, which you're chair of,

230
20:58.660 --> 21:04.660
 released a report in 2016 called "A Blueprint for a Federated System of Public Health Surveillance."

231
21:04.660 --> 21:08.660
 It recommended that provinces and the feds work closer together.

232
21:08.660 --> 21:10.660
 It said there were gaps in how they shared data.

233
21:10.660 --> 21:13.660
 It said there were differences in how they collect data.

234
21:13.660 --> 21:18.660
 I'm wondering sort of what progress has been made on implementing that report's recommendations

235
21:18.660 --> 21:24.660
 to a more aligned system between the provinces and the federal government.

236
21:24.660 --> 21:30.660
 &gt;&gt;Yeah, so I think data is extremely important, obviously, to any outbreak.

237
21:30.660 --> 21:35.660
 And, you know, pandemic is to this scale.

238
21:35.660 --> 21:40.660
 From a regular outbreak perspective, we have some very well-run mechanisms.

239
21:40.660 --> 21:45.660
 Foodborne outbreaks being a very key concept of this is that we react very fast.

240
21:45.660 --> 21:48.660
 Information is shared.

241
21:48.660 --> 21:55.660
 But something of this scale in the respiratory domain, there's obviously some gaps,

242
21:55.660 --> 22:00.660
 particularly reporting to the national level that we do have to address.

243
22:00.660 --> 22:06.660
 Some of it is timeliness, but some of the fields cannot be completed by the jurisdictions

244
22:06.660 --> 22:09.660
 at the moment when we look at the completion rates.

245
22:09.660 --> 22:13.660
 So we are actively trying very hard to figure out, well, what is needed?

246
22:13.660 --> 22:16.660
 Is it more support at different levels?

247
22:16.660 --> 22:19.660
 Can the system be made more efficient?

248
22:19.660 --> 22:24.660
 Because efficiency in the system helps our front-line public health workers as well,

249
22:24.660 --> 22:30.660
 who are very busy doing certain things, that there may be system efficiencies.

250
22:30.660 --> 22:33.660
 Of course, the data comes from many different areas.

251
22:33.660 --> 22:36.660
 It's the complexity of the Canadian landscape of data, I think.

252
22:36.660 --> 22:38.660
 Some data has to come from hospitals.

253
22:38.660 --> 22:39.660
 It has to come from labs.

254
22:39.660 --> 22:42.660
 It has to come from local public health units.

255
22:42.660 --> 22:50.660
 But I think it is absolutely recognized, and also at the First Minister's level,

256
22:50.660 --> 22:58.660
 that this is absolutely another chance for us to improve on what we're doing.

257
22:58.660 --> 23:06.660
 But, you know, I think capitalizing on the sort of crisis that we have,

258
23:06.660 --> 23:11.660
 we need to give it another good go for the next piece.

259
23:11.660 --> 23:12.660
 Thank you.

260
23:12.660 --> 23:13.660
 Follow-up?

261
23:13.660 --> 23:14.660
 Yeah.

262
23:14.660 --> 23:19.660
 I'm wondering, what are sort of the barriers in bringing this data together?

263
23:19.660 --> 23:20.660
 Is it jurisdictional?

264
23:20.660 --> 23:24.660
 Is it that provinces don't want to ease up on their control over health care?

265
23:24.660 --> 23:28.660
 And also, do you think not having shared data has hindered our ability

266
23:28.660 --> 23:32.660
 to respond to this pandemic?

267
23:32.660 --> 23:35.660
 So it is a federated system,

268
23:35.660 --> 23:39.660
 and the public health system is a local level-up system.

269
23:39.660 --> 23:42.660
 And we collaborate to get data.

270
23:42.660 --> 23:47.660
 So that's always been the construct, is one of collaborative approach.

271
23:47.660 --> 23:51.660
 And so the most important thing, of course, is at the local level,

272
23:51.660 --> 23:56.660
 they have the data that they need to actually respond to the identification of cases

273
23:56.660 --> 24:00.660
 and the follow-up of contacts, which we all know is very important.

274
24:00.660 --> 24:01.660
 That's the key.

275
24:01.660 --> 24:08.660
 So then is the reporting then from the local jurisdiction to the provincial level.

276
24:08.660 --> 24:14.660
 That is under the jurisdiction of the province and territories.

277
24:14.660 --> 24:17.660
 From the province to the federal level,

278
24:17.660 --> 24:21.660
 because we at the federal level don't do the day-to-day case management.

279
24:21.660 --> 24:27.660
 The data is needed, and the data is useful to the local jurisdictions,

280
24:27.660 --> 24:28.660
 and they have been actioning.

281
24:28.660 --> 24:32.660
 They have been providing advice, public health advice,

282
24:32.660 --> 24:34.660
 based on the local level information.

283
24:34.660 --> 24:37.660
 But it is important to get the national picture

284
24:37.660 --> 24:43.660
 and to be able to provide that to policymakers as well.

285
24:43.660 --> 24:48.660
 So I think we have the basic information,

286
24:48.660 --> 24:53.660
 but I think what people needed and is asking for now is more what we call this

287
24:53.660 --> 24:58.660
 aggregation, more in-depth analysis.

288
24:58.660 --> 25:01.660
 We have things like age or sex,

289
25:01.660 --> 25:07.660
 but there is a need to have First Nations, Inuit, Métis data,

290
25:07.660 --> 25:11.660
 as well as race or ethnicity-based data as well.

291
25:11.660 --> 25:14.660
 So those are the kind of things that we need to work on,

292
25:14.660 --> 25:19.660
 because if you're fine-tuning your policies to support vulnerable populations,

293
25:19.660 --> 25:20.660
 that's important.

294
25:20.660 --> 25:23.660
 We do know, of course, we have data, for example,

295
25:23.660 --> 25:29.660
 to provide measures or policies or programs to those most at risk,

296
25:29.660 --> 25:33.660
 which is the seniors and the people with underlying medical conditions,

297
25:33.660 --> 25:34.660
 et cetera.

298
25:34.660 --> 25:38.660
 So the kind of data is available and is driving the response right now,

299
25:38.660 --> 25:41.660
 as you can see in the different jurisdictions and long-term care.

300
25:41.660 --> 25:45.660
 But I think it is important to take that next stage so that we have a more

301
25:45.660 --> 25:52.660
 in-depth analysis to further support particularly vulnerable populations.

302
25:52.660 --> 25:53.660
 Thank you.

303
25:53.660 --> 25:54.660
 Next question, CTV.

304
25:54.660 --> 25:55.660
 Hi, Doctors.

305
25:55.660 --> 25:56.660
 Molly Thomas, CTV National News.

306
25:56.660 --> 26:00.660
 Dr. Tam, I understand more evidence of asymptomatic symptoms has influenced

307
26:00.660 --> 26:03.660
 the mask recommendation, but did we drop the ball here?

308
26:03.660 --> 26:07.660
 I mean, I think of smaller countries, the Czech Republic, Vietnam,

309
26:07.660 --> 26:12.660
 even Venezuela have had mandatory masks in place for quite some time.

310
26:12.660 --> 26:13.660
 Do you regret this decision,

311
26:13.660 --> 26:18.660
 and could we have prevented the spread here if it was a different decision?

312
26:18.660 --> 26:23.660
 Well, I think the decision was taken to essentially ask people to stay at

313
26:23.660 --> 26:27.660
 home, and the quarantine periods, the isolation of cases

314
26:27.660 --> 26:32.660
 and quarantining of contact has been the mainstay of the recommendation.

315
26:32.660 --> 26:40.660
 So we have effectively stopped and decelerated that epidemic wave.

316
26:40.660 --> 26:42.660
 So that actually has been effective.

317
26:42.660 --> 26:47.660
 So when I say the tried-and-true public health measures,

318
26:47.660 --> 26:51.660
 the identification of cases, contacts, isolation, quarantine,

319
26:51.660 --> 26:56.660
 hand-washing, physical distancing has worked.

320
26:56.660 --> 27:00.660
 But you need -- so this is an added layer on top of that.

321
27:00.660 --> 27:05.660
 And I do think that it is important as we begin to reopen.

322
27:05.660 --> 27:08.660
 Now, people no longer staying at home.

323
27:08.660 --> 27:11.660
 More people will be going outside.

324
27:11.660 --> 27:14.660
 Public transit may be more crowded as a result.

325
27:14.660 --> 27:19.660
 This will help us reopen and add another layer to that

326
27:19.660 --> 27:22.660
 how-do-you-go-out-safely message, I think.

327
27:22.660 --> 27:26.660
 But the message to Canadians must remain all of those, you know,

328
27:26.660 --> 27:30.660
 previous measures with this as an added layer of protection.

329
27:30.660 --> 27:34.660
 And so then we will still have to collect some information.

330
27:34.660 --> 27:38.660
 The kind of data to show the efficacy of the non-medical mask on top of

331
27:38.660 --> 27:42.660
 everything else might actually be quite difficult to discern because

332
27:42.660 --> 27:44.660
 multiple things are happening.

333
27:44.660 --> 27:48.660
 But it would be very interesting still to try and look in the Canadian

334
27:48.660 --> 27:55.660
 context what this has produced as people adopt this measure more widely.

335
27:55.660 --> 27:58.660
 No regrets?

336
27:58.660 --> 28:05.660
 We need to flexibly, you know, change our measures as we get more information.

337
28:05.660 --> 28:12.660
 But as I've just said, it's always been if you were infectious,

338
28:12.660 --> 28:15.660
 that was at the beginning when we thought that the majority had symptoms,

339
28:15.660 --> 28:20.660
 you do put a face covering on to prevent transmission.

340
28:20.660 --> 28:24.660
 If you're even at home looking after a sick person, that's distancing,

341
28:24.660 --> 28:26.660
 but the mask.

342
28:26.660 --> 28:32.660
 So I think adding on this layer as we learn more was the appropriate thing to do.

343
28:32.660 --> 28:35.660
 And I think we need to focus on the here and now,

344
28:35.660 --> 28:38.660
 the whole hindsight thing people can review.

345
28:38.660 --> 28:42.660
 But maybe on all future respiratory outbreaks,

346
28:42.660 --> 28:45.660
 this will be the actual norm to do.

347
28:45.660 --> 28:52.660
 And so I think we need to sort of look forward to what might be the approach

348
28:52.660 --> 28:55.660
 in Canada going forward.

349
28:55.660 --> 28:57.660
 About testing.

350
28:57.660 --> 29:00.660
 So you said on average we're testing about 28,000 people a day.

351
29:00.660 --> 29:03.660
 A week and a half ago I talked to you I think it was 26,000 on average.

352
29:03.660 --> 29:07.660
 So we're like a slow crawl up to that goal of 60,000.

353
29:07.660 --> 29:10.660
 What is the holdup here?

354
29:10.660 --> 29:15.660
 So 60,000 is the capacity that is already there for public health labs.

355
29:15.660 --> 29:22.660
 So your question is why are we only doing, you know, 28 or maybe higher?

356
29:22.660 --> 29:23.660
 Some days it is higher.

357
29:23.660 --> 29:25.660
 This is a bit of an average.

358
29:25.660 --> 29:31.660
 So this is something that at the highest levels of governments people are seized with.

359
29:31.660 --> 29:35.660
 A lot of this in talking to the chief medical officer, for example,

360
29:35.660 --> 29:40.660
 in British Columbia, they just said that their level of infection has really come down.

361
29:40.660 --> 29:44.660
 There's no one with much in the way of respiratory illness.

362
29:44.660 --> 29:47.660
 They will, of course, widen.

363
29:47.660 --> 29:53.660
 Everybody is widening their community testing to include even mild symptoms.

364
29:53.660 --> 29:58.660
 And sometimes people are not actually showing up.

365
29:58.660 --> 30:04.660
 And so it depends, I think, on the access, the uptake of the testing on the ground,

366
30:04.660 --> 30:07.660
 not necessarily because they don't have the capacity,

367
30:07.660 --> 30:16.660
 but also because of what the local medical officers feel to be in line with where they are in the epidemic.

368
30:16.660 --> 30:25.660
 But having said that, we are looking at absolutely how do we appropriately increase testing.

369
30:25.660 --> 30:29.660
 For example, you've seen in certain provinces they are looking at the vulnerable settings,

370
30:29.660 --> 30:34.660
 long-term care, where they are looking at testing people in that setting,

371
30:34.660 --> 30:39.660
 whether they're symptomatic or not, and the people who work there.

372
30:39.660 --> 30:45.660
 So there's also systematic pilots or surveillance being done in different jurisdictions,

373
30:45.660 --> 30:50.660
 and we're going to share that information across the country to see if people can learn from each other

374
30:50.660 --> 30:53.660
 as to what's the appropriate area for increasing testing.

375
30:53.660 --> 30:56.660
 So all that is at play.

376
30:56.660 --> 31:02.660
 But the key is that you need to have a sensitive enough system to detect any resurgence of cases

377
31:02.660 --> 31:04.660
 and then clamp down on the context.

378
31:04.660 --> 31:07.660
 So that is the fundamental principle.

379
31:07.660 --> 31:09.660
 Thank you. Next question, Toronto Star.

380
31:09.660 --> 31:12.660
 Dr. Tam, hi, Taunta McCharles with the Star.

381
31:12.660 --> 31:15.660
 Well, that leads to what I was going to ask you about.

382
31:15.660 --> 31:21.660
 So specifically, since you've talked so much today on so many topics about the need to respect jurisdictions,

383
31:21.660 --> 31:27.660
 I'm curious, what exactly are the elements that the federal level has proposed as a national framework

384
31:27.660 --> 31:35.660
 on testing and contact tracing that the Prime Minister said was tabled last week to provinces?

385
31:35.660 --> 31:44.660
 So I think all provinces and territories know that some of the three fundamental aspects,

386
31:44.660 --> 31:50.660
 so the criteria and the indicators are sort of laid down in the recommendations

387
31:50.660 --> 31:55.660
 or the guidance of the Special Advisory Committee, which is the Public Health Foundation,

388
31:55.660 --> 32:04.660
 for which testing, contact tracing, and then isolation and quarantine is the fundamental public health

389
32:04.660 --> 32:08.660
 and the pinnings or principle for this next phase.

390
32:08.660 --> 32:13.660
 So everybody knows that that is absolutely critical.

391
32:13.660 --> 32:19.660
 Everybody knows that we have to increase capacity to detect any resurgence

392
32:19.660 --> 32:25.660
 and build the capacity towards any potential increase if we're to see that in the fall.

393
32:25.660 --> 32:30.660
 We hope that we can sort of clamp down on, you know, any sparks and introductions.

394
32:30.660 --> 32:35.660
 So the suppression of any sparks is really key.

395
32:35.660 --> 32:42.660
 I think the federal government's key role is I think the Prime Minister has offered resources,

396
32:42.660 --> 32:47.660
 support to the provinces as needed to ramp up their capacity.

397
32:47.660 --> 32:58.660
 We are supporting, of course, supplies, swabs, reagents, if there's a need for any other further support as well.

398
32:58.660 --> 33:05.660
 And, you know, committed to, you know, looking at what else the provinces need.

399
33:05.660 --> 33:10.660
 We provide guidance, of course, and these are updated as appropriate.

400
33:10.660 --> 33:19.660
 So to look at what population needs to be tested over time as well.

401
33:19.660 --> 33:25.660
 Actually, the National Framework on Testing and Contract Tracing proposed then,

402
33:25.660 --> 33:31.660
 is it overstating the case to say that you've proposed a national framework

403
33:31.660 --> 33:33.660
 on how testing and contact tracing should go forward?

404
33:33.660 --> 33:37.660
 You've just referred to guidelines and criteria that you came up with weeks ago.

405
33:37.660 --> 33:42.660
 So has there something new been put on the table or no?

406
33:42.660 --> 33:48.660
 So I think that speaks to a higher level commitment that is a wider strategy, I think,

407
33:48.660 --> 33:57.660
 that is not just, of course, the technical guidance, but looking at supplies and other resources and support that would be required.

408
33:57.660 --> 34:05.660
 But fundamentally, we've always had a strategy for laboratory testing, which is founded on public health guidance.

409
34:05.660 --> 34:07.660
 And that changes over time.

410
34:07.660 --> 34:14.660
 So at the beginning, it was targeted more at travelers because that's where the epidemiology is at.

411
34:14.660 --> 34:21.660
 At the peak of the epidemic, it is focused and people are asked to stay at home and if they have mild symptoms.

412
34:21.660 --> 34:29.660
 And so at that stage, the testing approach, the strategy is focused on the sickest people

413
34:29.660 --> 34:35.660
 and areas of outbreaks like long-term care and health care workers.

414
34:35.660 --> 34:42.660
 As we begin to get this first wave under control and into this recovery reopening phase,

415
34:42.660 --> 34:47.660
 it's about widening then that testing, for example, to people with mild symptoms

416
34:47.660 --> 34:53.660
 who were never sort of in the previous phase was necessarily tested.

417
34:53.660 --> 35:01.660
 Now we're expanding the testing to particularly symptomatic but with mild symptoms,

418
35:01.660 --> 35:08.660
 as well as a very low threshold for testing everybody under certain high-risk settings,

419
35:08.660 --> 35:14.660
 whether it be long-term care, acute care, correctional services, shelters,

420
35:14.660 --> 35:20.660
 indigenous populations that are at higher risk of the severe impacts.

421
35:20.660 --> 35:24.660
 And so this is fundamental to the strategy.

422
35:24.660 --> 35:30.660
 And also then, how do we widen surveillance and having surveillance systems,

423
35:30.660 --> 35:33.660
 which are built upon respiratory illness surveillance,

424
35:33.660 --> 35:37.660
 but maybe there are other surveillance approaches that we can take.

425
35:37.660 --> 35:42.660
 We call those pilots or surveillance activities, which can take into account,

426
35:42.660 --> 35:45.660
 for example, the testing of asymptomatic people.

427
35:45.660 --> 35:50.660
 So that is the actual approach, which varies and will be adapted.

428
35:50.660 --> 35:57.660
 So I think it's an adaptive testing strategy, which is now moving into the next phase.

429
35:57.660 --> 36:05.660
 At the same time as doing that, ramping up our capacity in every single channel that we can.

430
36:05.660 --> 36:11.660
 So the other aspect of the strategy is that right now there are three modalities we're looking at.

431
36:11.660 --> 36:17.660
 One, the existing ramping up of the laboratory-based PCR testing.

432
36:17.660 --> 36:22.660
 That is the key to testing whether you have the infection now.

433
36:22.660 --> 36:25.660
 Widening that from the lab-based to point-of-care.

434
36:25.660 --> 36:30.660
 So that's part of the strategy, getting point-of-care tests, getting supplies,

435
36:30.660 --> 36:34.660
 particularly to cover the rural and more remote areas.

436
36:34.660 --> 36:36.660
 That is still a work in progress.

437
36:36.660 --> 36:42.660
 We're getting GeneXpert and Express, SARS-CoV-2 test kits.

438
36:42.660 --> 36:49.660
 Now, you've seen the Lalache, you've seen Nunavut and others having these supplies.

439
36:49.660 --> 36:54.660
 So point-of-care, particularly to cover those areas, very important.

440
36:54.660 --> 36:57.660
 Thirdly, you've heard the Immunity Task Force.

441
36:57.660 --> 37:03.660
 Serology will become the third component of the testing strategy.

442
37:03.660 --> 37:09.660
 One, the primary key aspect of that, as you've probably already heard,

443
37:09.660 --> 37:14.660
 is to conduct those serosurveys, which we believe will be conducted pretty fast,

444
37:14.660 --> 37:18.660
 to uncover how much of the population, what's the prevalence

445
37:18.660 --> 37:20.660
 and how much of the population has been infected.

446
37:20.660 --> 37:25.660
 That is important for policy decisions, not just now, but as we get a vaccine,

447
37:25.660 --> 37:31.660
 for example, in the future to know what the population immunity is

448
37:31.660 --> 37:35.660
 and where we might be going with vaccination strategies.

449
37:35.660 --> 37:42.660
 Those same prevalence studies, together with actual research on the immunology

450
37:42.660 --> 37:46.660
 of the response to -- of the body, the antibody response,

451
37:46.660 --> 37:49.660
 you're in other aspects of immune response,

452
37:49.660 --> 37:55.660
 will then help the further use of serology for an individual diagnostic basis.

453
37:55.660 --> 37:59.660
 Right now, that is not ready for prime time.

454
37:59.660 --> 38:06.660
 So that, to me, lays out the actual strategy and the modalities of the testing approaches.

455
38:06.660 --> 38:09.660
 But fortunately, there's a lot of research right now,

456
38:09.660 --> 38:13.660
 and there will be other tests that could potentially be available,

457
38:13.660 --> 38:19.660
 at which point those will also be scoped into the strategy itself.

458
38:19.660 --> 38:20.660
 Thank you, Doctor.

459
38:20.660 --> 38:21.660
 We'll go back to the phone.

460
38:21.660 --> 38:23.660
 Operator.

461
38:23.660 --> 38:24.660
 Thank you.

462
38:24.660 --> 38:25.660
 Thank you.

463
38:25.660 --> 38:28.660
 Next question, Micheline Laflamme from Radio-Canada.

464
38:28.660 --> 38:29.660
 The floor is yours.

465
38:29.660 --> 38:39.660
 I would like to know, what was the determining factor

466
38:39.660 --> 38:43.660
 that led you to issue this recommendation?

467
38:43.660 --> 38:51.660
 Did it take you by surprise from all the heads of public health agencies in the provinces?

468
38:51.660 --> 38:54.660
 Did you expect a consensus?

469
38:54.660 --> 38:58.660
 Finally, I would like to know, what was the determining factor in your decision?

470
38:58.660 --> 39:00.660
 Thank you for the question.

471
39:00.660 --> 39:01.660
 It's Dr. New.

472
39:01.660 --> 39:05.660
 Yes, it continues to be, as we say, an actual issue.

473
39:05.660 --> 39:10.660
 Dr. Tam and I continue our discussions with our homologues.

474
39:10.660 --> 39:15.660
 Science has also changed, has evolved.

475
39:15.660 --> 39:18.660
 At the beginning of the pandemic here in Canada,

476
39:18.660 --> 39:27.660
 our recommendation was based on what we saw on the ground.

477
39:27.660 --> 39:36.660
 Most of the transmission is caused by asymptomatic people.

478
39:36.660 --> 39:41.660
 But with the experience around the world and here in Canada,

479
39:41.660 --> 39:49.660
 we've learned that it's also possible that asymptomatic people can transmit the virus.

480
39:49.660 --> 39:55.660
 We don't know exactly what the percentage is.

481
39:55.660 --> 40:01.660
 We think it's still most of the transmission is caused by asymptomatic people.

482
40:01.660 --> 40:07.660
 But with the evidence now, we've discussed, we've changed.

483
40:07.660 --> 40:13.660
 Dr. Tam and I said at the beginning that doctors and hygienists are heads of all the provinces and territories.

484
40:13.660 --> 40:18.660
 Everyone had a consensus to say that it's like a permissive council.

485
40:18.660 --> 40:25.660
 Now, with the change, with the jurisdictions, the administrations of the provinces and territories

486
40:25.660 --> 40:30.660
 who are now ready to soften their own public health measures,

487
40:30.660 --> 40:37.660
 that means that, OK, now everyone, with the summer, maybe everyone won't stay at home.

488
40:37.660 --> 40:40.660
 It's with the beautiful weather, we'll get out of the house.

489
40:40.660 --> 40:47.660
 But with that, it's maybe another, how do you say, another risk.

490
40:47.660 --> 40:56.660
 Maybe if people take the common transport or maybe in other environments,

491
40:56.660 --> 41:02.660
 it's difficult to keep a physical distance of two meters or more.

492
41:02.660 --> 41:08.660
 It's with that, also with the circumstances that have changed with the summer coming,

493
41:08.660 --> 41:13.660
 that hygienists, heads of the provinces and territories, with Dr. Tam and me,

494
41:13.660 --> 41:18.660
 we're now in the space to say, OK, it's more of a recommendation.

495
41:18.660 --> 41:21.660
 But also in certain circumstances, it's not across the country.

496
41:21.660 --> 41:27.660
 We've already seen that, yes, the circumstances, what's actually happening in Montreal

497
41:27.660 --> 41:32.660
 is completely different from what's happening in the north with the territories.

498
41:32.660 --> 41:39.660
 That's why we've changed, maybe a little bit, recommended, but in certain circumstances.

499
41:39.660 --> 41:42.660
 Is that clearer now? Thank you.

500
41:42.660 --> 41:44.660
 Yes. Yes, thank you.

501
41:44.660 --> 41:49.660
 And by the way, I know you've read a lot about it,

502
41:49.660 --> 41:53.660
 but can it also give a false sense of security?

503
41:53.660 --> 41:58.660
 Because we saw it at the end of the week, we see that people wear it more,

504
41:58.660 --> 42:01.660
 but no longer respect physical distancing.

505
42:01.660 --> 42:08.660
 So is it a kind of message that agencies will have to carry

506
42:08.660 --> 42:12.660
 to ensure that the initial measures are respected?

507
42:12.660 --> 42:15.660
 Because right now, in some places,

508
42:15.660 --> 42:20.660
 we don't think people don't seem to respect this physical distancing.

509
42:20.660 --> 42:27.660
 Not a concern, but everyone here among us, with our counterparts, yes.

510
42:27.660 --> 42:35.660
 If we now recommend the use of non-medical masks,

511
42:35.660 --> 42:39.660
 we don't want the general population to think,

512
42:39.660 --> 42:47.660
 "Oh, yes, we can maybe drop the other public health measures that are already well established."

513
42:47.660 --> 42:50.660
 And it's clear that they are effective.

514
42:50.660 --> 42:55.660
 So the physical distancing, washing your hands often,

515
42:55.660 --> 43:01.660
 you absolutely have to keep the good principles of public health, the good measures.

516
43:01.660 --> 43:06.660
 And that's also, as we always say, another additional measure.

517
43:06.660 --> 43:09.660
 Thank you, Dr. Operator. Any other questions?

518
43:09.660 --> 43:12.660
 Thank you.

519
43:12.660 --> 43:16.660
 The next question is from Althea Raj from the HuffPost Canada.

520
43:16.660 --> 43:18.660
 Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

521
43:18.660 --> 43:20.660
 Thank you very much.

522
43:20.660 --> 43:23.660
 Dr. Tan, my question is about proper mask etiquette.

523
43:23.660 --> 43:26.660
 A few weeks ago, you were mentioning how important this was,

524
43:26.660 --> 43:31.660
 but could you kindly walk the public through how to take off your mask properly

525
43:31.660 --> 43:34.660
 when I go from one store to another store?

526
43:34.660 --> 43:36.660
 Can I reuse my mask?

527
43:36.660 --> 43:38.660
 Should I be putting on a new mask?

528
43:38.660 --> 43:42.660
 Should I be carrying a little baggie in which to put my contaminated mask?

529
43:42.660 --> 43:47.660
 What is proper mask etiquette?

530
43:47.660 --> 43:56.660
 So I think I would also point people to the website.

531
43:56.660 --> 43:59.660
 I'm trying to think, Canada.ca/coronavirus,

532
43:59.660 --> 44:03.660
 because it will be easier, I think, for people to get the different steps

533
44:03.660 --> 44:06.660
 from the information as well.

534
44:06.660 --> 44:11.660
 And so, yes, so I think one key --

535
44:11.660 --> 44:16.660
 some of the recommendations pertain to materials.

536
44:16.660 --> 44:20.660
 In fact, there's actually quite interesting studies now,

537
44:20.660 --> 44:24.660
 not -- now that there's more interest in wearing a non-medical mask,

538
44:24.660 --> 44:29.660
 but the most basic materials are like cotton,

539
44:29.660 --> 44:33.660
 but you have to have different layers so that when you hold it up to the light,

540
44:33.660 --> 44:35.660
 you know, the light doesn't shine through.

541
44:35.660 --> 44:39.660
 So there's different tips as to what kind of materials to use.

542
44:39.660 --> 44:42.660
 But I think the other thing is also fit,

543
44:42.660 --> 44:50.660
 so that you can't have, you know, gaping air coming through the side of your mask,

544
44:50.660 --> 44:58.660
 for example, so making sure that it fits your face and et cetera.

545
44:58.660 --> 45:01.660
 So handwashing, as we all know, is the key to everything,

546
45:01.660 --> 45:05.660
 and frequent handwashing, so before you put on a mask.

547
45:05.660 --> 45:10.660
 When you're removing a mask, it's actually very important as well,

548
45:10.660 --> 45:14.660
 and try not to touch the external side of your mask, for instance,

549
45:14.660 --> 45:17.660
 but certainly washing your hands.

550
45:17.660 --> 45:24.660
 And you can -- I think carrying a Ziploc bag or something is actually important

551
45:24.660 --> 45:27.660
 because then you can put your mask in it when you're not wearing it.

552
45:27.660 --> 45:30.660
 Now, that is -- you're not letting other people touch your mask.

553
45:30.660 --> 45:33.660
 I think that's very important.

554
45:33.660 --> 45:38.660
 And that you are using it yourself and using the hand hygiene.

555
45:38.660 --> 45:47.660
 And, of course, having washable materials that you can then wash at home,

556
45:47.660 --> 45:49.660
 I think, is important.

557
45:49.660 --> 45:55.660
 But, yeah, don't use -- well, definitely don't let other people touch your mask.

558
45:55.660 --> 45:58.660
 Your whole concept is protecting other people.

559
45:58.660 --> 46:01.660
 If it's your own secretions, it's your own secretions.

560
46:01.660 --> 46:06.660
 Keep it to yourself and wash your hands really well, I think.

561
46:06.660 --> 46:07.660
 Thank you, Doctor.

562
46:07.660 --> 46:10.660
 Doctor, maybe I'd just add to that on the practical side.

563
46:10.660 --> 46:13.660
 So you mentioned that you're going from store to store.

564
46:13.660 --> 46:17.660
 The most important thing when you're adjusting elastics is don't touch your face, right?

565
46:17.660 --> 46:21.660
 You can put your elastics here and put your mask on.

566
46:21.660 --> 46:26.660
 And, of course, I think many stores now or many places in public

567
46:26.660 --> 46:29.660
 have obviously the hand sanitizers, et cetera.

568
46:29.660 --> 46:33.660
 So if you are then adjusting your mask and so on, as often as you can,

569
46:33.660 --> 46:38.660
 as Dr. Tham says, wash your hands or take advantage of the hand sanitizers as well.

570
46:38.660 --> 46:41.660
 But the most important thing in terms of the mask that we've seen

571
46:41.660 --> 46:44.660
 is that it sometimes gives people a false sense of assurance,

572
46:44.660 --> 46:47.660
 and then they unknowingly or whatever, by fiddling with the mask,

573
46:47.660 --> 46:49.660
 they end up touching their face.

574
46:49.660 --> 46:52.660
 And as we know, the most important parts to try and protect and not touch

575
46:52.660 --> 46:57.660
 because that's how the virus enters is actually your eyes, your nose, and your mouth.

576
46:57.660 --> 46:59.660
 Yeah, that's a really good point.

577
46:59.660 --> 47:02.660
 I think the key is, yes, we have a lot of --

578
47:02.660 --> 47:07.660
 public health always has a lot of key messages in terms of --

579
47:07.660 --> 47:11.660
 because we're all a bit worried that with this added layer of protection,

580
47:11.660 --> 47:13.660
 people forget other things.

581
47:13.660 --> 47:15.660
 But I'm actually pretty confident in Canadians.

582
47:15.660 --> 47:17.660
 I think people can learn and adapt.

583
47:17.660 --> 47:21.660
 And this is one aspect that I think we will all learn

584
47:21.660 --> 47:27.660
 as we go forward together in the next days and months.

585
47:27.660 --> 47:30.660
 Thank you, Althea. Follow-up?

586
47:30.660 --> 47:31.660
 Thanks.

587
47:31.660 --> 47:35.660
 So we've had a few questions from the public about the wearing of masks.

588
47:35.660 --> 47:37.660
 And I'm wondering -- I know you said, obviously,

589
47:37.660 --> 47:39.660
 circumstances are different across the country.

590
47:39.660 --> 47:43.660
 But for people in urban centres where there has been community spread,

591
47:43.660 --> 47:49.660
 would you like to see employers -- sorry, employees in stores wear masks?

592
47:49.660 --> 47:52.660
 Should joggers wear masks when they hit crowded paths?

593
47:52.660 --> 47:56.660
 If you have folks over in your backyard, should these people be wearing masks?

594
47:56.660 --> 48:00.660
 Thanks.

595
48:00.660 --> 48:04.660
 So I'm sure there's a lot of different situations and permutations,

596
48:04.660 --> 48:10.660
 and local medical officers are no doubt answering very similar questions.

597
48:10.660 --> 48:17.660
 As people restart certain businesses, they -- in every jurisdiction,

598
48:17.660 --> 48:23.660
 there's instructions in terms of providing a plan for your reopening,

599
48:23.660 --> 48:28.660
 which includes in many -- so the situation,

600
48:28.660 --> 48:34.660
 what we call the hierarchy of controls in terms of protecting staff,

601
48:34.660 --> 48:36.660
 but also customers.

602
48:36.660 --> 48:41.660
 And they don't -- it's not just -- mask, again, is an added layer of protection

603
48:41.660 --> 48:47.660
 because you actually have to look at physical barriers like plexiglass.

604
48:47.660 --> 48:49.660
 You have to look at schedules.

605
48:49.660 --> 48:54.660
 You have to look at how you're going to reduce the numbers of people, perhaps,

606
48:54.660 --> 48:57.660
 whether it's in your office setting or the store,

607
48:57.660 --> 48:59.660
 in order to get that physical distancing.

608
48:59.660 --> 49:04.660
 So that physical distancing still remains a fundamental aspect of this.

609
49:04.660 --> 49:09.660
 So then you're looking at your specific circumstances in terms of your workplace,

610
49:09.660 --> 49:12.660
 what that workplace is, who you're serving,

611
49:12.660 --> 49:16.660
 and as to whether the non-medical mask is appropriate.

612
49:16.660 --> 49:21.660
 But obviously, again, the fundamental principle being,

613
49:21.660 --> 49:28.660
 if you're in a crowded space, you can't maintain that two-meter distance.

614
49:28.660 --> 49:35.660
 I think the outdoors is definitely less of a risk than indoors.

615
49:35.660 --> 49:40.660
 So I think for people jogging, if you're on the outdoors

616
49:40.660 --> 49:44.660
 and you're just sort of passing someone very quickly,

617
49:44.660 --> 49:53.660
 that is a much lower risk than if you were inside, for sure.

618
49:53.660 --> 49:54.660
 Thank you.

619
49:54.660 --> 49:57.660
 (Speaking French)

620
49:57.660 --> 49:58.270
 Thank you.

621
49:58.295 --> 49:58.317
(Speaking French)

622
54:56.660 --> 54:57.660
 Next question, CBC.

623
54:57.660 --> 55:03.660
 Can I just add that, again, patience and compassion is needed

624
55:03.660 --> 55:06.660
 in even looking at mask use.

625
55:06.660 --> 55:13.660
 I just want to sort of remind people that for people with disabilities,

626
55:13.660 --> 55:18.660
 we need to make sure that we have some understanding as to their needs,

627
55:18.660 --> 55:21.660
 including the wearing of non-medical masks,

628
55:21.660 --> 55:25.660
 and particularly for masks and the hearing impaired.

629
55:25.660 --> 55:29.660
 They and their communication partner, for example,

630
55:29.660 --> 55:33.660
 there needs to be consideration for maybe having a clear face shield

631
55:33.660 --> 55:39.660
 or other means so that those who are hearing impaired can continue

632
55:39.660 --> 55:46.660
 to be sort of considered in all of this.

633
55:46.660 --> 55:54.660
 So why I think it's important for Canadians to sort of think of this measure

634
55:54.660 --> 55:58.660
 as being you protecting others and others protecting you

635
55:58.660 --> 56:05.660
 is to generate that concept of, you know, solidarity, really.

636
56:05.660 --> 56:15.660
 And so I think please be very aware of those with different types of cognitive,

637
56:15.660 --> 56:19.660
 intellectual disabilities, those who are hearing impaired, and others.

638
56:19.660 --> 56:24.660
 So just be patient and don't assume that someone who isn't wearing a mask

639
56:24.660 --> 56:28.660
 or is wearing something different doesn't have an actual reason for it.

640
56:28.660 --> 56:31.660
 Thank you.

641
56:31.660 --> 56:32.660
 CBC.

642
56:32.660 --> 56:34.660
 Julie Van Dusen, CBC.

643
56:34.660 --> 56:37.660
 Dr. Tam, I'm wondering if you could blame Canadians for being confused.

644
56:37.660 --> 56:40.660
 It wasn't so long ago that you said, "Don't bother wearing a mask

645
56:40.660 --> 56:43.660
 because it might protect others, but it wouldn't do much for you."

646
56:43.660 --> 56:46.660
 And now you're saying, "If you wear one, you protect me.

647
56:46.660 --> 56:48.660
 If I wear one, I protect you."

648
56:48.660 --> 56:51.660
 Can you explain the evolution?

649
56:51.660 --> 56:54.660
 So it's always been sort of protecting others.

650
56:54.660 --> 56:58.660
 So non-medical masks, medical masks aside, that's to prevent--

651
56:58.660 --> 57:03.660
 with eyes covering and all PPE is to prevent you getting infected by others,

652
57:03.660 --> 57:05.660
 particularly health care workers.

653
57:05.660 --> 57:11.660
 Wearing non-medical masks has always been protecting others if you're infected.

654
57:11.660 --> 57:15.660
 So it's always you protecting others.

655
57:15.660 --> 57:18.660
 And so at the beginning, it was about people who have symptoms,

656
57:18.660 --> 57:20.660
 who should wear a mask.

657
57:20.660 --> 57:25.660
 If you say in the home setting, on an airplane,

658
57:25.660 --> 57:28.660
 if you found someone who is sick or going--

659
57:28.660 --> 57:30.660
 you have to go to the clinic or something,

660
57:30.660 --> 57:34.660
 then the sick person should wear the mask.

661
57:34.660 --> 57:36.660
 Now here you're considering, if you think about it,

662
57:36.660 --> 57:42.660
 if you're in a community where there has actually been transmission of the virus,

663
57:42.660 --> 57:46.660
 just consider everybody as potentially being that sick patient

664
57:46.660 --> 57:48.660
 because you can't actually tell.

665
57:48.660 --> 57:49.660
 So that's the change.

666
57:49.660 --> 57:54.660
 Asymptomatic people could potentially be infected or potentially transmit.

667
57:54.660 --> 57:58.660
 Again, you're using that covering to protect others.

668
57:58.660 --> 58:03.660
 So that concept is the same all the way through.

669
58:03.660 --> 58:08.660
 But at this particular time when people have used the tried-and-true measure

670
58:08.660 --> 58:11.660
 of staying at home and physical distancing,

671
58:11.660 --> 58:15.660
 beginning to go outside and beginning to get to those more crowded places

672
58:15.660 --> 58:18.660
 where you can't control that two-meter distance,

673
58:18.660 --> 58:21.660
 wearing the non-medical mask or facial covering, again,

674
58:21.660 --> 58:25.660
 protects others from you if you happen to be infected.

675
58:25.660 --> 58:27.660
 And it's a reciprocal thing.

676
58:27.660 --> 58:31.660
 So if everybody is wearing a mask, you're protecting others.

677
58:31.660 --> 58:35.660
 And by the other way around, they're protecting you as well.

678
58:35.660 --> 58:38.660
 So could you just explain what exactly is new today

679
58:38.660 --> 58:40.660
 about what you're talking about?

680
58:40.660 --> 58:45.660
 Because in the past week or so, two weeks, you've said wear a cloth mask

681
58:45.660 --> 58:47.660
 if you go to a crowded place like a grocery store

682
58:47.660 --> 58:49.660
 if you can't keep physical distancing.

683
58:49.660 --> 58:52.660
 Now you're saying the same thing today except you're recommending it.

684
58:52.660 --> 58:55.660
 What is different, especially if it's voluntary, even in hot zones?

685
58:55.660 --> 58:56.660
 Like what is the news today?

686
58:56.660 --> 58:59.660
 Could you please explain that very clearly?

687
58:59.660 --> 59:02.660
 Well, there's no actual real news.

688
59:02.660 --> 59:07.660
 The key is that we're about to post the actual wording,

689
59:07.660 --> 59:10.660
 which I've been actually communicating for some time,

690
59:10.660 --> 59:14.660
 and it is based on a consensus with the other chief medical officers of health

691
59:14.660 --> 59:21.660
 so that it's to provide further clarification, I think, across the country.

692
59:21.660 --> 59:25.660
 But there is flexibility, as I said, for the local medical officers,

693
59:25.660 --> 59:28.660
 depending on their situation and risk assessment,

694
59:28.660 --> 59:32.660
 to recommend that to their local population,

695
59:32.660 --> 59:35.660
 and you have to listen to your local public health.

696
59:35.660 --> 59:37.660
 Big difference is you're putting it on your website.

697
59:37.660 --> 59:41.660
 Is that the news, what you've been saying for the last 10 days or so?

698
59:41.660 --> 59:42.660
 Yeah, just to reinforce that, yes.

699
59:42.660 --> 59:43.660
 Okay.

700
59:43.660 --> 59:44.660
 Thank you.

701
59:44.660 --> 59:45.660
 Thank you, Julian.

702
59:45.660 --> 59:46.660
 Last question, Mike.

703
59:46.660 --> 59:47.660
 All right, hello.

704
59:47.660 --> 59:52.660
 Dr. Tam, you're testing 28,000 a day.

705
59:52.660 --> 59:55.660
 The lab capacity is 60,000.

706
59:55.660 --> 59:59.660
 So basically we're not testing 60,000 a day

707
0:59:59.660 --> 1:00:01.660
 because we're going to get false positives, we're going to get false negatives.

708
1:00:01.660 --> 1:00:04.660
 It's not helpful.

709
1:00:04.660 --> 1:00:10.660
 But say there was 30 clusters that just exploded out there.

710
1:00:10.660 --> 1:00:17.660
 Do we have the capacity today to do 60,000 lab tests a day if we need to?

711
1:00:17.660 --> 1:00:20.660
 Yes, and it's not us or the federal government.

712
1:00:20.660 --> 1:00:25.660
 This is the public health system in Canada, so that is their capacity.

713
1:00:25.660 --> 1:00:30.660
 So they can ramp up if there's a cluster that needed to be tested.

714
1:00:30.660 --> 1:00:35.660
 Of course, this capacity is distributed across the country.

715
1:00:35.660 --> 1:00:38.660
 If there is a particular area of the country where--

716
1:00:38.660 --> 1:00:41.660
 let's say you're in northern Saskatchewan, you get an outbreak.

717
1:00:41.660 --> 1:00:45.660
 The key is that we will support whichever jurisdiction with surge

718
1:00:45.660 --> 1:00:47.660
 if they need that too.

719
1:00:47.660 --> 1:00:51.660
 So that's really important because the capacity is easier to reach

720
1:00:51.660 --> 1:00:54.660
 if you were closer to the bigger centers.

721
1:00:54.660 --> 1:01:00.660
 We are going to be sort of supporting the more remote areas.

722
1:01:00.660 --> 1:01:02.660
 But even the point-of-care test is a machine.

723
1:01:02.660 --> 1:01:04.660
 You have to be trained to how to use that.

724
1:01:04.660 --> 1:01:06.660
 But they can be deployed, they can be reinforced,

725
1:01:06.660 --> 1:01:09.660
 so that what you brought up is a really important point.

726
1:01:09.660 --> 1:01:12.660
 If you spot a case in the context, if there's a cluster,

727
1:01:12.660 --> 1:01:14.660
 you've got to move in really fast.

728
1:01:14.660 --> 1:01:18.660
 And the laboratory capacity is designed to be able to do that.

729
1:01:18.660 --> 1:01:21.660
 Okay, and we have all the supplies and stuff ready to go

730
1:01:21.660 --> 1:01:26.660
 in case this happens tomorrow or a month from now?

731
1:01:26.660 --> 1:01:31.660
 Yes, so as of this moment, I know that there's enough supplies.

732
1:01:31.660 --> 1:01:35.660
 But as you know, every day, all those situations could change,

733
1:01:35.660 --> 1:01:40.660
 and we work every single day to make sure that we have what we need.

734
1:01:40.660 --> 1:01:43.660
 So that is the capacity that we have.

735
1:01:43.660 --> 1:01:46.660
 But that doesn't mean that tomorrow I may not tell you

736
1:01:46.660 --> 1:01:50.660
 that there's a potential issue or something.

737
1:01:50.660 --> 1:01:54.660
 But the good news is that there's more and more capacity,

738
1:01:54.660 --> 1:01:57.660
 and there's more and more domestic capacity.

739
1:01:57.660 --> 1:01:58.660
 Thank you.

740
1:01:58.660 --> 1:02:00.660
 That's all for today's press conference.

741
1:02:00.660 --> 1:02:01.660
 Thank you.

742
1:02:01.660 --> 1:02:02.660
 Thank you.

743
1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:12.660
