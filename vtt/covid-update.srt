Maxie okay maybe so maybe my next one

199
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,180
would be for you dr. Tam so so what

200
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,060
exactly has changed for you now to say

201
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,670
we recommend because you were saying

202
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,470
that the mask does not protect the

203
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,779
person that was wearing it I am assuming

204
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,930
that this is still the case so what has

205
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,300
changed for you now to go the extra step

206
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,630
and not just say this is a good idea

207
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,450
this can be done now it is we recommend

208
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,740
that you do this mm-hmm yep so that's

209
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,330
it's a specific recommendation if you

210
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,520
like are supposed to be I think the

211
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,670
previous language was more permissive so

212
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,510
I think just to rewind a little bit the

213
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,720
chief medical officers position from the

214
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,120
start was that of course these masts

215
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,899
protect others so if you're wearing it

216
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,540
you're protecting other people against

217
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,560
your droplets so at the start it was put

218
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,970
obviously someone who is sick who is

219
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,279
coughing or sneezing if they're going to

220
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,320
go out or have to go to a medical

221
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,779
appointment for example they need to

222
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,300
cover the calf and and with facial

223
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,640
covering or mass that is for the sick

224
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,540
person so it's when we got more evidence

225
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,350
about asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic

226
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,600
individuals and that although we don't

227
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,910
fully understand their role in

228
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,550
transmission it is an added layer of

229
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,400
protection even for people who don't

230
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,860
have symptoms to wear masks to prevent

231
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,910
transmission to others and even though

232
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,890
the evidence space hasn't changed too

233
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,850
much and particularly as people have

234
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,440
generally been staying at home

235
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,020
particularly and now that we are sort of

236
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,560
reopening or restarting a lot of the

237
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,649
activities the chief McArthur's felt

238
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:59,790
that they can recommend this for people

239
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,920
who cannot maintain that 2 meter

240
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,700
distance and more specifically if of

241
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,080
course if there's virus in your

242
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,960
there's been a community transmission in

243
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,320
your jurisdiction and I start a new said

244
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,380
you know jurisdictions felt that they

245
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,140
need to do that risk assessment because

246
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,760
there's some provinces and territories

247
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,280
that haven't had community transmission

248
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,220
and others have clearly have and

249
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,860
continues to have community transmission

250
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,930
activities so they will do the

251
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,360
individual risk assessments in terms of

252
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,270
the various specific recommendations

253
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,060
locally but I think you know from our

254
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,680
perspective it is an added layer of

255
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,960
protection it is for you to protect

256
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,360
others so if two people are in Mass I'm

257
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,460
protecting you and you're protecting me

258
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,210
and so I think as more people do go out

259
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,410
in the community you can imagine

260
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,760
there'll be more people on public

261
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,700
transport or maybe more people some of

262
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,420
the retail stores are beginning to open

263
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,760
for example and if you can't predict

264
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,470
whether you can maintain that to me the

265
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,170
distance then is recommended that you

266
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,330
wear the non-medical masks or facial

267
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,170
covering merci docteur next next

268
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,580
question operator thank you the next

269
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,920
question is from Mike Blanche field from

270
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:26,530
The Canadian Press please go ahead yeah

271
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,780
hi I guess this is a question for dr.

272
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,960
Tam we've seen radically different

273
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,330
approaches in the provinces to largest

274
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,440
provinces Ontario Quebec on reopening

275
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,000
you know especially when it comes to

276
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,620
schooling especially and we heard what

277
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,780
Dark Lord said yesterday how do you

278
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,900
explain the differences an approach to

279
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,030
reopening easing of restrictions and

280
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,690
these two highly afflicted Canada to

281
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:58,600
largest provinces so at the federal

282
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,630
level and working with the provinces

283
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,650
essentially the chief medical officers

284
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,960
we we have provided guidance and

285
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,140
criteria but obviously the provinces

286
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,250
want to retain their own ability to

287
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,780
adjust their approaches as I think even

288
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,920
in the global context I don't know that

289
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,220
there's

290
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,459
absolute white halfway down this curve

291
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:27,129
as I've said people have to do whatever

292
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:30,819
they do cautiously and slowly using the

293
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:33,129
best information they have in their own

294
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:36,670
particular contexts and that if they

295
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,629
were you know reopening or loosening

296
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:44,050
certain measures they need to have the

297
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,420
necessary systems to detect whether that

298
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,269
has led to and the increase in cases or

299
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:52,540
clusters so I think whatever pathway

300
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,750
down this curve there is no

301
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,569
one-size-fits-all and there is a certain

302
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:01,660
element of uncertainty but if you do it

303
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,850
more cautiously and monitor it and

304
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,889
adjust as needed that is the key

305
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:15,129
principle thank you follow-up all right

306
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,410
well how do you square the differences

307
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,879
anyway I mean there are two very similar

308
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,689
provinces similar sets of circumstances

309
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:24,310
does it surprise you from a scientific

310
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,769
point of view that two extremely

311
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,389
different conclusions can be reached

312
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:31,920
under these circumstances well I think

313
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,209
as the local jurisdictions one aspect

314
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,730
which are not sure is particularly

315
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,860
evident is that I think Public Health is

316
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,980
also trying to take a holistic approach

317
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,629
not just balancing these are the

318
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:48,939
effective public health measures but

319
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:52,059
also looking at the negative

320
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,879
consequences as well you need to have

321
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,579
some balance you need to bring back

322
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:00,639
certain activities and certain measures

323
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,980
getting people outside for instance the

324
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,790
outside is less risk because we know

325
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,529
transmission generally occurs and

326
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:10,720
particularly transmission to large

327
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,079
numbers people occurs indoors and so I

328
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,850
think all of those has to be taken to

329
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,480
account but in some areas there may be a

330
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,540
good reason why certain things are being

331
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,629
opened and in order to support the

332
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,910
community in their local context as well

333
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,449
and it's a balance between the need to

334
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:34,029
reduce the spread of disease compared to

335
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:35,110
all the other

336
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,420
from a health social and economic

337
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,850
perspective it's afternoon I guess we

338
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,380
would add that even and with any

339
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,880
province you can see their differences

340
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,170
because obviously the provincial

341
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,390
authorities know more what's happening

342
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,130
on the ground dr. Tam and myself they

343
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,780
have the data they know what's what's

344
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,310
actually happening on the ground and so

345
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,990
we can see in the province of Quebec

346
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,270
that what's happening on the island of

347
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,930
Montreal and how they may be relaxing

348
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,090
their measures a you know maybe in a

349
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,650
slower fashion based on the epidemiology

350
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,150
of what's happening in one trellis

351
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,470
compared to the rest of the province of

352
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,360
Quebec that's that's a prime example

353
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,400
that even with any province that there

354
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,500
needs to be a careful look at obviously

355
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,120
taking account what's happening locally

356
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,610
to make the best possible decisions

357
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,010
based on what what they know in terms of

358
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,590
the epidemiology thank you thank you

359
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:25,120
upper next question Thank You Missy the

360
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,850
portion disco madness tell the developer

361
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,410
to move hi dr. Tim my question is for

362
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,480
you I think I have an idea of the answer

363
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,000
but I would like to hear you explain why

364
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,580
is your recommendation today on non

365
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,170
surgical masks why is it only a

366
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,020
recommendation and why are you not

367
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,990
making it mandatory canada-wide to wear

368
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,810
a mask when we go outside is it a

369
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,910
question of jurisdiction is it a

370
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,680
question of their just wouldn't be

371
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,590
enough masks to make it mandatory is it

372
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,410
a question of Rights can you explain why

373
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,860
it remains only a recommendation it's

374
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,480
like the National OVA remains a

375
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,690
recommendation and asks the meta causes

376
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,550
of health needs to look at their own

377
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,430
particular context in terms of whether

378
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,010
they actually have evidence of community

379
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,290
transmission and some areas actually

380
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,540
don't and have actually never had

381
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,310
community transmission it's very

382
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,130
different from say maybe you know

383
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,869
compare doctor news at comparing

384
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:30,760
Montreal and Toronto to Yukon or the PEI

385
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,010
might actually be very different so they

386
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,560
need that ability to make those

387
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,510
recommendations their public

388
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,160
transportation systems might be

389
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,670
different for example and so they they

390
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,860
need the ability to do that risk

391
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,950
assessment and recommend it from from

392
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,550
their

393
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,700
- from the federal perspective and

394
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,980
Transport Canada of course given that

395
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,060
the federal jurisdiction did make with

396
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,650
the wearing of non-medical masks

397
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,040
mandatory on those conveniences so that

398
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,370
is within the federal jurisdiction its

399
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,530
doctrine you maybe I just add certainly

400
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,240
understand that the interest in terms of

401
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,130
the use of a non-medical mask you know

402
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,050
by the general public but one of the

403
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,480
issues were also obviously with our

404
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,980
counterparts and provinces and

405
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,510
territories looking at closely is that

406
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,240
the unintended consequences where if you

407
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,580
people think that by wearing a mask in

408
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,350
public they don't need to follow all of

409
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,610
the other important public health

410
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,890
measures that we've been underlining uh

411
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,690
so many times in terms of guarding you

412
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,340
know that the distance of physical

413
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,950
distancing of 2 meters etc so that's one

414
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,120
of the things I think we still need to

415
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,290
underline that this is quote a

416
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,060
supplementary measure that people can

417
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,950
use to protect themselves when it's

418
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,110
difficult to maintain that physical

419
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,940
distancing of 2 meters but it certainly

420
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,550
does not replace all of the other good

421
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:57,490
measures such as hand-washing etc thanks

422
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,130
another follow-up - sorry there's an

423
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,430
echo as a follow-up dr. Tim so that as

424
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,350
you mentioned previously it was already

425
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,900
suggested to wear a non-medical mask

426
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,970
when we go outside now it's recommended

427
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,580
but in in places like Quebec for example

428
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,290
it has been recommended strongly

429
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,080
recommended for a week already and we

430
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,200
see that people are not necessarily

431
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,700
wearing it outside at the grocery store

432
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,460
or in other locations where they can't

433
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,520
social distance so what exactly can you

434
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,760
do as public health officials to ensure

435
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,010
that something actually changes on the

436
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,110
ground your language is changing but

437
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:40,240
people aren't wearing it more I can't

438
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,610
speak to the very local jurisdiction and

439
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,840
they will adjust their approach as

440
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,340
needed but I think from certain public

441
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,040
opinion research etc Canadians are

442
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,570
wearing more masks and they are more

443
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,520
that the social cultural shift is

444
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,840
beginning to occur

445
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,450
so part of what public health is doing

446
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,020
is you know the concept is one I think

447
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:14,560
of reciprocal protection so I think for

448
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,140
Canadians thinking of it as I'm

449
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,080
protecting you and you're protecting me

450
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,100
is a very key concept we have to gain

451
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,430
the trust of the Canadian public and get

452
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:32,230
their buy-in to do all of this mandating

453
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,630
is one measure which some jurisdictions

454
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:38,380
might take if they have to but for the

455
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,490
most part I do think that the shift is

456
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,840
occurring in the population as well

457
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,800
which I think is is great thank you

458
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,360
doctor will now turn to the room first

459
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,730
question yeah

460
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,960
Ryan Templeton with the National Post

461
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,840
the pan Canadian Public Health Care

462
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,540
Network which you're chair of wrote a

463
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,300
report in 2016 called a blueprint for a

464
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,770
federated system of Public Health

465
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,280
surveillance it recommended that

466
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,840
provinces and the feds work closer

467
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,520
together it said there were gaps and how

468
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,290
they share data said there were

469
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,360
differences in how they collect data I'm

470
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,490
wondering sort of what progress has been

471
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,890
made on implementing that reports

472
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,260
recommendations to a more aligned system

473
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,180
between the provinces and the federal

474
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,790
government yes so I think data is

475
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,770
extremely important obviously to any

476
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:34,120
outbreak and you know pandemic is into

477
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,230
this scale from a regular outbreak

478
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,850
perspective we have some very well run

479
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,470
mechanisms your foodborne outbreaks

480
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,170
being a very key concept of this is that

481
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,190
we react very fast information is shared

482
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,360
and but

483
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,730
but something of this scale and the

484
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,820
respiratory domain that's obviously some

485
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,190
gaps particularly reporting to the

486
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,350
national level that we do have to

487
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,630
address some of it is timeliness but

488
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,510
some of the fields cannot be completed

489
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,330
by the jurisdictions at the moment when

490
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,640
we look at the completion rates so we

491
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,010
are actively trying very hard to figure

492
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,960
out where what is needed is it more

493
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,370
support

494
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,140
at different levels is that can the

495
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,160
system be made more efficient because

496
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,360
efficiency in the system helps our

497
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,640
frontline public health workers as well

498
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,500
who are very busy doing certain things

499
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,590
that the sister there may be system

500
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,660
efficiencies of course the day that

501
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,700
comes from many different areas and it's

502
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,530
the complexity of the Canadian landscape

503
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,510
of data I think some data has to come

504
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,760
from hospitals they come from labs it

505
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,320
has to come from local public health

506
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,600
units and that so but I think it is

507
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,240
absolutely recognized and also at the

508
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,870
First Minister's level that this is an

509
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,059
absolutely another chance for us to

510
00:22:55,059 --> 00:23:00,040
improve on what we're doing but you know

511
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,080
I think capitalizing on the sort of

512
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,230
crisis that we have we need to give it

513
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,490
an another good go for the next piece

514
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,320
thank you follow-up yeah I'm wondering

515
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,420
what were those what are sort of the

516
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,850
barriers in bringing this data together

517
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,820
is it jurisdictional is it the provinces

518
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,830
don't want to ease up on their control

519
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,380
over health care and also do you think

520
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,510
not having shared data has hindered our

521
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,620
ability to respond to this pandemic so

522
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,460
we it is a federated system and the

523
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,380
public health system is a local level up

524
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,670
system and we collaborate to get data so

525
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,950
that's always been the construct is one

526
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:49,030
of a collaborative approach and so the

527
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,830
most important thing of course is at the

528
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,870
local level they have the data that they

529
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,080
need to actually respond to the

530
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,520
identification of cases and the

531
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,980
follow-up of contacts which we all know

532
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,660
is very important that's the key

533
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,510
so then is the reporting then from the

534
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,460
local jurisdiction to the provincial

535
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,650
level that has to be sort of that is

536
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,330
under the jurisdiction of the provinces

537
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,300
and territories from the province to the

538
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,360
federal level is we at the federal level

539
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,760
don't do the day-to-day case management

540
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,750
that the data is needed and the data is

541
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,210
useful to the local drinks and they have

542
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,020
been action

543
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,230
they have been providing advise public

544
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,820
health advice based on the local level

545
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,880
information but it is important to get

546
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,100
the national picture and to be able to

547
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:44,140
provide that to policymakers as well so

548
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,400
I think we have the basic information in

549
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,910
but I think what people needed and it's

550
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,070
asking for now is more what we call this

551
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:58,990
aggregation more in-depth analysis we

552
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,010
have things that age or sex but there is

553
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:06,750
a need to have First Nations Inuit matey

554
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,929
data as well as race ethnicity base data

555
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:12,970
as well so those are the kind of things

556
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,800
that we need to work on because if

557
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,500
you're fine-tuning your policies to

558
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,780
support vulnerable populations that's

559
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,880
important we do know of course we have

560
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,130
data for example to provide measures or

561
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,260
policies or programs to those most at

562
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,110
risk which is the seniors and the people

563
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,210
with underlying medical conditions etc

564
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,130
so that those the kind of data is

565
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,500
available is driving the response right

566
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,179
now as you can see in the different

567
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:42,790
jurisdictions in long term care but I

568
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,830
think it is important to take that next

569
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,720
stage so that we have a more in-depth

570
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,840
analysis to further support particularly

571
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,870
vulnerable populations thank you next

572
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,390
question CTV hi doctors Molly Thomas CTV

573
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,429
national news dr. Tam I understand you

574
00:25:57,429 --> 00:25:59,140
know more evidence of asymptomatic

575
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,820
symptoms has influenced the mask

576
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,580
recommendation but did we drop the ball

577
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,440
here I mean I think of smaller country

578
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,840
it's a Czech Republic Vietnam even

579
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,330
Venezuela have had mandatory masks in

580
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,400
place for quite some time

581
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,380
do you regret this decision and could we

582
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,090
have prevented the spread here if it was

583
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,179
a different decision I think the

584
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:22,450
decision was taken to essentially ask

585
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,880
people to stay at home and they to the

586
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,890
quarren the the quarantine parents the

587
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,020
isolation of cases in quarantine of

588
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,260
contact has been the mainstay of the

589
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,050
recommendation so we have effectively

590
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:39,010
stopped and the B and D saturated that

591
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,870
epidemic wave so

592
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,790
that actually has been effective so when

593
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,850
I say they tried and true public health

594
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:49,690
versus those the identification of cases

595
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,700
contacts isolation quarantine

596
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,460
hand-washing physical distancing has

597
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,320
worked but you need so this is an added

598
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,559
layer on top of that and I do think that

599
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,830
it is important as we begin to reopen

600
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,530
that people no longer staying at home

601
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,770
more people will be going outside public

602
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,429
transit may be more crowded as a result

603
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:19,150
this will help us reopen and add another

604
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,400
layer to that how do you go out safely

605
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,130
message I think but the message the

606
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,679
Canadians must remain all of those you

607
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:29,530
know previous measures with this as an

608
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,070
added layer of protection and so then we

609
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,179
will still have to collect some

610
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:36,100
information that kind of data to show

611
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,650
the efficacy of the non-medical mass on

612
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,110
top of everything else might actually be

613
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,850
quite difficult to discern because that

614
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,190
multiple things are happening but it

615
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,830
would be very interesting still to try

616
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,710
and look in the Canadian context what

617
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,590
this has produced as as people adopt

618
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:58,559
this measure more widely no regrets

619
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:03,910
we need to flexibly you know change our

620
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,460
measures as we get more information but

621
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,460
as I've just said B has always been if

622
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,780
you were infectious that was at the

623
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,250
beginning when we thought that the

624
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,340
majority had symptoms you do what opaque

625
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,500
phase covering on to prevent

626
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,910
transmission the other if you even at

627
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,250
home looking after sick person yes this

628
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,040
isn't sing but the mask so I think

629
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,730
adding on this layer as we know more was

630
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,179
the appropriate thing to do and I think

631
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,650
we need to focus on the here and there

632
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,260
the whole hindsight thing people can

633
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,620
review but maybe on all future

634
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,470
respiratory outbreaks this will be the

635
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,980
actual norm to do and so I think we need

636
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,140
to sort of look forwards to what might

637
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:55,369
be the approach in Canada

638
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:58,259
about testing um so you said on average

639
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:00,689
we're testing about 28,000 people a day

640
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:02,399
week and a half ago I talked to you I

641
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,499
think it was 26,000 on average so we're

642
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:06,449
like a slow crawl up to that goal of

643
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:12,299
60,000 what is the holdup here so 60,000

644
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,399
is the capacity that is already there

645
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,309
for public health labs so your question

646
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:21,779
is why are we only doing you know 28 or

647
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:23,669
maybe higher some days they it is higher

648
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:27,629
this is a bit of an average so this is

649
00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:29,939
something that at the highest levels of

650
00:29:29,939 --> 00:29:32,579
governments people are seized with a lot

651
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:35,069
of this in talking to the chief medical

652
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:37,619
for example in British Columbia they

653
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:39,809
just said that their level of infection

654
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:42,119
has really come down there's no one with

655
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:44,729
much in the way of a respiratory illness

656
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:48,809
they will of course widen everybody is

657
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:52,109
widening their community testing to

658
00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:55,709
include even mild symptoms and sometimes

659
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:58,739
people are not actually showing up and

660
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:02,219
so it depends I think on the access the

661
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:05,249
uptake of the testing on the ground not

662
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:06,539
necessary because they don't have the

663
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:10,349
capacity but also because of what the

664
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:13,979
local Medical says feel to be in line

665
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,919
with where they are in the epidemic but

666
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,809
having said that we looking at

667
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:21,959
absolutely

668
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:25,499
how do we appropriately increase testing

669
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:27,119
for example you've seen in certain

670
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,129
provinces they're looking at the

671
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:30,719
vulnerable settings a long-term care

672
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:34,349
where they are looking at testing people

673
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:35,699
in that setting whether they're

674
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:37,499
symptomatic or not and the people who

675
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:40,739
work there so there's so there's also

676
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:44,339
systemic pilots or surveillance being

677
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:45,929
done in different jurisdictions and

678
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:46,949
we're going to share the information

679
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:49,679
across the country to see if people can

680
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,539
learn from each other as to what's the

681
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:54,269
appropriate area for increasing testing

682
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,239
so all that is at play but the key is

683
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:59,639
that you need to have a sensitive enough

684
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:02,759
system to detect any resurgence of cases

685
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,949
and then clamp down on the contact so

686
00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:07,620
that is the fundamental principle

687
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,260
thank you next question on toast our dr.

688
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,750
Jim Hite endemic Charles with the star

689
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,120
I'm well duck leads to what I was going

690
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,680
to ask you about but so specifically

691
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,600
since you've talked so much today on so

692
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,820
many topics about the need to respect

693
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,520
jurisdictions I'm curious what exactly

694
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,340
are the elements that the federal level

695
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,559
has proposed as a national framework on

696
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,780
testing and contact tracing that the

697
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,880
prime minister said was tabled last week

698
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:39,630
two provinces so I think or province

699
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,110
territories know that the sum of the

700
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,630
three fundamental aspects so the

701
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,580
criteria and the indicators are sort of

702
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,210
laid down in in the recommendations or

703
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,890
the guidance of the special advisory

704
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,290
committee which is the family how

705
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,980
foundation for which testing contact

706
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,570
tracing and then isolation and

707
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:03,450
Quarantine is the fundamental public

708
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,929
health underpinnings or principle for

709
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:10,620
this next phase so everybody knows that

710
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,570
that is absolutely critical everybody

711
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,429
knows that we have to increase capacity

712
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:20,460
to detect any resurgence and build a

713
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,860
capacity towards any potential increase

714
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,890
if we're to see that in the fore we hope

715
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,260
that we can sort of clamp down on you

716
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,570
know any sparks and introductions show

717
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,290
the suppression of any sparks is really

718
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:37,559
key I think the federal government's key

719
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,570
role is I think the the Prime Minister

720
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:43,170
offered resources support to the

721
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,840
provinces as needed to ramp up their

722
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,590
capacity we are supporting of course

723
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:54,830
applies swabs reagents if there's a need

724
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,750
for any other further support as well

725
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:02,670
and you know committed to you know

726
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,679
looking at what else the province is

727
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:07,230
needs we provide guidance of course and

728
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:11,910
these updated as as appropriate so to

729
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:15,450
look at what population needs to be

730
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:20,700
tested over time as well so actually

731
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,950
Phil national framework on testing and

732
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,890
contract tracing proposed then it is it

733
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:28,830
is it overstating the case to say that

734
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,560
you've proposed a national framework on

735
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,660
how testing and contact tracing should

736
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,680
go forward you've just referred to

737
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,540
guidelines that and criteria that you

738
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,610
came up with weeks ago so because

739
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,440
there's something new been put on the

740
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,010
table or no so I think that speaks to

741
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,740
the a higher level commitment that is a

742
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,530
wider strategy I think that is not just

743
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,710
of course the technical guidance but

744
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,390
looking at supplies and other resources

745
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,920
and support that would be required but

746
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,180
fundamentally we've always had a

747
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,700
strategy for laboratory testing which is

748
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,400
founded on public health guidance and

749
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,280
that changes over time so at the

750
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,620
beginning it was targeted more at

751
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,260
travelers because of the that's where

752
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,690
the epidemiology is at at the peak of at

753
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,120
the epidemic it is focused and people

754
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,699
are asked to stay at home and if they

755
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,690
have mild symptoms and so at that stage

756
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,699
the testing approach the strategy is

757
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:30,480
focused on the sickest people and areas

758
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,139
of outbreaks like long term care and

759
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:38,250
health care workers as we begin to get

760
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,800
this first way from the control and into

761
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,710
this recovery reopening phase is about

762
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,620
widening then that testing for example

763
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,630
to people with mild symptoms who would

764
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,290
never sort of in the previous phase was

765
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:56,880
necessary tested now we're expanding the

766
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,210
testing to particularly symptomatic but

767
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:03,750
with mild symptoms as well as a very low

768
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,900
threshold for testing everybody in under

769
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,570
certain high-risk settings whether it be

770
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:12,870
long term care acute care correctional

771
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:16,020
services shelters indigenous populations

772
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,320
that are at higher risk of their severe

773
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,980
impacts and so this is fundamental to

774
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,090
the strategy and also then how do we

775
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,250
widen surveillance and having

776
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,810
surveillance systems which are built

777
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,090
upon respiratory illness surveillance

778
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,500
but maybe there are others

779
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,050
surveillance approaches that we can take

780
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,620
we call those pilots or surveillance

781
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,240
activities which can take into account

782
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,070
for example the testing of asymptomatic

783
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,010
people so that is the actual approach

784
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,790
which varies and will be adapted so I

785
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,030
think is an adapter an adaptive testing

786
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,340
strategy which is now moving into the

787
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,220
next phase at the same time as doing

788
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,000
that ramping up our capacity in every

789
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,540
single channel that we can so the other

790
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,970
aspect of the strategy is that right now

791
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,640
there are three modalities we're looking

792
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,510
at one the existing ramping up after

793
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,930
laboratory based PCR testing that is the

794
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,850
key to testing whether you have the

795
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:24,300
infection now widening that from the lab

796
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,120
base to point of care so that's part of

797
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,460
the strategy getting point of care test

798
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,730
getting supplies particularly to cover

799
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,670
the rural and more remote areas that is

800
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,860
still a work in progress we're getting

801
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:41,640
gene expert an expert Express task heavy

802
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,000
to test kits now you've seen the lelouch

803
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,490
you've seen nineveh and others having

804
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,260
these supplies so point-of-care

805
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,700
particularly to coverage those areas

806
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,850
very important thirdly you've heard the

807
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,050
immunity task force

808
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,720
serology will become the third component

809
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,820
of the testing strategy one the primary

810
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,240
key aspect of that as you've probably

811
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,610
already heard is to conduct those Cyril

812
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,440
surveys which we believe will be

813
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,650
conducted pretty fast to uncover how

814
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,030
much of the population what's the

815
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,320
prevalence and how much of the

816
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,810
population has been infected that is

817
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,180
important for policy decisions not just

818
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,030
now but as we get a vaccine for example

819
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,460
in the future to know what the

820
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,150
population immunity is and where we

821
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,590
might be going with vaccination

822
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:38,640
strategies those same prevalence studies

823
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,370
together with actual research on the

824
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:44,490
immunology of the response to of the

825
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,710
body the antibody response you're in

826
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:50,170
aspects of immune response will then

827
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,190
help the further use of serology for an

828
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,410
individual diagnostic basis right now

829
00:37:56,410 --> 00:38:00,430
that is not ready for prime time so that

830
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,220
to me lays out the actual strategy and

831
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,890
the modalities or the testing approaches

832
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,920
but fortunately there's a lot of

833
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,390
research right now and there will be

834
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,910
other tests that could potentially be

835
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,980
available at which point those will be

836
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:19,020
also be scoped into the strategy itself

928
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:13,250
Kassim Nestle thank you

929
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,830
the next question is from Althea arise

930
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,050
from the HuffPost Canada please go ahead

931
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,310
your line is now open

932
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:22,040
I thank you very much doctor tell my

933
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,440
question is about proper mask etiquette

934
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,330
a few weeks ago you were mentioning how

935
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,190
important this was but could you kindly

936
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:31,220
walk the public through how to take off

937
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,920
your mask properly when I go from one

938
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,410
store to another store can I reuse my

939
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,540
mask should I be putting on a new mask

940
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,310
should I be carrying a little baggy in

941
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,620
which to put my contaminated masks

942
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:47,710
what are what is proper mask etiquette

943
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:52,580
so I think I would also point people to

944
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:58,520
the website I'm trying to think Canada

945
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,040
dossier / coronavirus because it would

946
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,290
be easier I think for people to get the

947
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,300
different steps from from the

948
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,350
information as well and so yes so I

949
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:12,170
think one key some of the

950
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:16,790
recommendations pertain to materials in

951
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,240
fact there's actually quite interesting

952
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,970
studies now not now that there's more

953
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,070
interest in wearing non-medical masks

954
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:25,619
but

955
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:28,740
but the most basic materials are like

956
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,450
cotton but you have to have different

957
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:32,400
layers so that you when you hold it up

958
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,829
to the light I mean the light doesn't

959
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:36,450
shine through so there's different tips

960
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,869
as to what kind of materials use but I

961
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:42,809
think the other thing is also fit so

962
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:48,240
that you can't have you know gaping air

963
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,640
coming through the side of your mouth

964
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,519
for example so making sure that it fits

965
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:59,849
your your face and etc so hand washing

966
00:44:59,849 --> 00:45:01,589
as we all know is the key to everything

967
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:04,470
and frequent hand washing so before you

968
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,380
put a mask when you're removing a mass

969
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,859
is actually very important as well and

970
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:13,349
try not to touch the external side of

971
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:15,269
your mass for instance but certainly

972
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:20,519
washing your hands and you can I think

973
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:23,730
carrying a set lock bag or something is

974
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,109
actually important because then you can

975
00:45:25,109 --> 00:45:26,640
put your mask in it when you're not

976
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,740
wearing it now that is you're not

977
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,079
letting other people touch your mask I I

978
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:34,410
think that's very important and and that

979
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:37,859
you are using it yourself and using the

980
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:41,279
hand hygiene and of course the you know

981
00:45:41,279 --> 00:45:43,529
having washable materials that you can

982
00:45:43,529 --> 00:45:48,150
then wash in at home I think is

983
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:53,549
important but yeah don't use well you

984
00:45:53,549 --> 00:45:55,440
definitely don't let other people touch

985
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,210
you masca your whole concept is

986
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:59,579
protecting other people if it's your own

987
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:01,769
secretions is your own secretions keep

988
00:46:01,769 --> 00:46:04,170
it to yourself and wash your hands

989
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:07,349
really well I think thank you doctor

990
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:09,690
maybe I just add to that sort of a

991
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,059
practical sight so if you mentioned when

992
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:13,410
you're going from store to store the

993
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,519
most important thing you know you're

994
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:16,499
adjusting elastics this don't touch your

995
00:46:16,499 --> 00:46:18,420
face right you know it's a it's a you

996
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,730
know you put your elastics here and put

997
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,920
them put your mask on and of course I

998
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,559
think I think many stores now or many

999
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:27,359
places in public have the obviously the

1000
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,749
the hand sanitizers etc so if you are

1001
00:46:30,749 --> 00:46:33,150
then you adjust your mask and so on as

1002
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:35,009
often as you can as dr. Tim says wash

1003
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:37,589
your hands or take advantage of the hand

1004
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:39,390
sanitizers as well but

1005
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:40,680
the most important thing in terms of the

1006
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,570
mask that we've seen is that it

1007
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,250
sometimes gives people a false sense of

1008
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,260
assurance and then they unknowingly or

1009
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,940
whatever by fiddling with the mask they

1010
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,530
end up touching their their face and as

1011
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:51,630
we know that the most important parts to

1012
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:53,220
try and protect and not touch because

1013
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,990
that's how the virus enters are actually

1014
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:58,170
your eyes your nose in your mouth that's

1015
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,630
a really good point I think the key is

1016
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,940
yes we have a lot of public health

1017
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,550
always has a lot of you know key

1018
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:08,850
messages in terms of because we're a bit

1019
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:11,190
worried that with this added layer of

1020
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:12,960
protection people forget other things

1021
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,060
but I'm actually pretty confident in

1022
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,830
Canadians I think people can learn and

1023
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:20,460
adapt and this is one aspect that I

1024
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,540
think we were all in as we go forward

1025
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,350
together in the next days and months

1026
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:31,650
Thank You LTF follow-up Thanks so we've

1027
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,840
had a few questions from the public

1028
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,730
about the wearing of masks and I'm

1029
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,040
wondering I know you said obviously

1030
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,880
circumstances are different across the

1031
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,250
country but for people in urban centers

1032
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,260
where there has been community spreads

1033
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,320
would you like to see employers and if

1034
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,870
they're employees in stores where masks

1035
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:51,270
should joggers wear masks when they hit

1036
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:53,730
crowded paths if you have folks over in

1037
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:55,620
your back yard should these people be

1038
00:47:55,620 --> 00:48:01,920
wearing masks Thanks so I'm sure there's

1039
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,780
a lot of different situations and

1040
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,930
permutations and you know local medical

1041
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:08,580
offices are no doubt answering very

1042
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:12,390
similar questions as people restarts

1043
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,230
certain businesses they in every

1044
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,960
jurisdiction there's instructions in

1045
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,200
terms of providing a plan for your

1046
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,900
reopening which includes in many of the

1047
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,910
situation what we call the hierarchy of

1048
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:33,150
controls and in terms of protecting

1049
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:37,740
staff but also customers and they don't

1050
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,380
it's not just mask again is an added

1051
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,260
layer of protection because you actually

1052
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,770
have to look at physical barriers like

1053
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:49,260
Plexiglas you have to look at schedules

1054
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,560
you have to look at how you're going to

1055
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,980
reduce and

1056
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,320
other people perhaps whether it's in

1057
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,869
your office setting or the store in

1058
00:48:57,869 --> 00:49:00,090
order to get that physical distancing so

1059
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:02,010
that that physical distancing still

1060
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,740
remains a fundamental aspect of this so

1061
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,420
then you're looking at your specific

1062
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,910
circumstances in terms of your workplace

1063
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:11,160
what that workplace is who you're

1064
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,190
serving and as to whether the

1065
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:17,630
non-medical mass is appropriate but

1066
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:20,609
obviously again the fundamental

1067
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:24,119
principle being if you're in a crowded

1068
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,430
space you can't maintain that 2 meter

1069
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:31,619
distance I think the outdoors is

1070
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:35,490
definitely less of a risk than indoors

1071
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:39,510
so I think for people jogging if you're

1072
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:42,180
on the outdoors and you you know just

1073
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,490
sort of passing somewhere very quickly

1074
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:47,250
that is a much lower risk than if you

1075
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:51,770
were inside for sure

1174

is needed in even looking at mask use I

1175
00:55:06,859 --> 00:55:10,609
just want to sort of remind people that

1176
00:55:10,609 --> 00:55:13,910
for for people with disabilities we need

1177
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,279
to make sure that we have some

1178
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:18,789
understanding as to their needs

1179
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:20,720
including the wearing of non-medical

1180
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,599
masks and particularly for mass and the

1181
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,480
hearing impaired they

1182
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,869
a communication partner for example

1183
00:55:28,869 --> 00:55:32,090
there needs to be consideration for

1184
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:33,890
maybe having a clear face shield or

1185
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:37,490
other means so that those who who are

1186
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:43,670
hearing-impaired can continue to be sort

1187
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:48,770
of considered in all of this so why I

1188
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:53,660
think it's important for Canadians to so

1189
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,970
the think of this measure as being you

1190
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:58,190
protecting others and others protecting

1191
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:03,980
you is to generate that concept of you

1192
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:08,200
know solidarity really and so I think

1193
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:14,050
please be very aware of those with

1194
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:15,650
different types of cognitive

1195
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:18,800
intellectual disabilities those who are

1196
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,900
hearing impaired and others so just be

1197
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,560
patient

1198
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,350
and don't assume that someone who isn't

1199
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:26,510
wearing a mask or is wearing something

1200
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:28,940
different doesn't have an actual reason

1201
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:31,270
for it thank you

1202
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:35,420
CBC Julie Van Deusen CBC dr. Tam I'm

1203
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,890
wondering if you could blame Canadians

1204
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:39,109
for being confused it wasn't so long ago

1205
00:56:39,109 --> 00:56:40,640
that you said don't bother wearing a

1206
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,460
mask because it might protect others but

1207
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,660
it wouldn't do much for you now you're

1208
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,850
saying if you wear one you protect me if

1209
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:49,880
I wear one I protect you can you explain

1210
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:53,720
the evolution so it's always been sort

1211
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,910
of protecting others a non-medical mass

1212
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:58,490
medical mass aside that's to prevent

1213
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:01,520
with eyes covering on all PPE is to

1214
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,260
prevent are you getting infected by

1215
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,170
others particular health care workers

1216
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:08,150
wearing non-medical mass has always been

1217
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:11,330
a protecting others from if you're

1218
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:13,700
infected so it's always you protecting

1219
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:17,270
others and so at the beginning it was

1220
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:19,430
about people who have symptoms who

1221
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:24,410
should wear masks if you say in the home

1222
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,540
setting on an airplane if you found

1223
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,850
someone who is sick or going you know

1224
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,260
you have to go to the clinic or

1225
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,109
something then the sick person should

1226
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:35,330
wear the mask now here you're

1227
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:36,859
considering if you think about it if

1228
00:57:36,859 --> 00:57:38,819
you're in the community where there is

1229
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:41,969
actual being transmission of the virus

1230
00:57:41,969 --> 00:57:44,549
just consider everybody as potentially

1231
00:57:44,549 --> 00:57:47,130
being that sick patient because you

1232
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,869
can't actually tell okay so that's the

1233
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:51,779
this change is asymptomatic people could

1234
00:57:51,779 --> 00:57:54,209
potentially be infected or potentially

1235
00:57:54,209 --> 00:57:56,160
transmitted again you're using that

1236
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,160
covering to protect others so that

1237
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,359
concept is the same all the way through

1238
00:58:02,359 --> 00:58:05,579
and but at this particular time when

1239
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:08,039
people have used the tried and true

1240
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:10,469
measure of staying at home and physical

1241
00:58:10,469 --> 00:58:13,109
distancing beginning to go outside and

1242
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:14,849
beginning to get to those more crowded

1243
00:58:14,849 --> 00:58:16,829
places where you can't control that 2

1244
00:58:16,829 --> 00:58:19,319
meter distance wearing the non-medical

1245
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:21,869
mass of facial covering again protects

1246
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:24,959
others from you if you happen to be

1247
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:27,779
infected and there's a reciprocal thing

1248
00:58:27,779 --> 00:58:29,969
so if everybody is wearing a mask you're

1249
00:58:29,969 --> 00:58:33,239
protecting others and by the other way

1250
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:35,849
around they're protecting you as well so

1251
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:38,009
could you just explain what exactly is

1252
00:58:38,009 --> 00:58:38,819
new today

1253
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:40,589
about what you're talking about because

1254
00:58:40,589 --> 00:58:43,439
in the past week or so two weeks you've

1255
00:58:43,439 --> 00:58:46,289
said wear a cloth mask if you go to a

1256
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:47,880
crowded place like a grocery store if

1257
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,069
you can't keep physical distancing now

1258
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:51,269
you're saying the same thing today

1259
00:58:51,269 --> 00:58:52,859
except you're recommending it what is

1260
00:58:52,859 --> 00:58:54,269
different especially if it's voluntary

1261
00:58:54,269 --> 00:58:56,729
even in hot zones like what is the news

1262
00:58:56,729 --> 00:58:58,469
today could you please explain that very

1263
00:58:58,469 --> 00:59:01,829
clearly well there's no actual real news

1264
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:04,829
and if the key is that we're about to

1265
00:59:04,829 --> 00:59:08,069
post the actual wording which I've been

1266
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:10,229
actually communicating for some time and

1267
00:59:10,229 --> 00:59:12,659
it is based on a consensus with the

1268
00:59:12,659 --> 00:59:15,390
other chief mark houses of health so

1269
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:18,179
that it's pretty provide further

1270
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:21,269
clarification I think across the country

1271
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:23,909
but there is flexibility as I said for

1272
00:59:23,909 --> 00:59:26,269
the local medical sustaining on their

1273
00:59:26,269 --> 00:59:29,279
situation and risk assessment to

1274
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:33,179
recommend that to their local population

1275
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:34,949
and you have to listen to your local

1276
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:37,109
public health big differences you're

1277
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:38,699
putting it on your website is that the

1278
00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:40,979
news what you've been saying for like

1279
00:59:40,979 --> 00:59:44,309
the last 10 days for that yes okay thank

1280
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:46,259
you thank you Julian last question Mike

1281
00:59:46,259 --> 00:59:51,179
hello dr. Tim this this your you're

1282
00:59:51,179 --> 00:59:53,430
testing 28,000 a day

1283
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:57,660
the lab capacity is 60,000 so basically

1284
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,700
we're not testing 60,000 today a day

1285
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,049
because we're gonna get false positives

1286
01:00:01,049 --> 01:00:02,250
we're going to get false negatives it's

1287
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:07,130
not it's not helpful but say there was

1288
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:10,380
30 clusters that just exploded out out

1289
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,480
there do we have the capacity today to

1290
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,480
do 60,000 lab tests a day if we need to

1291
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,789
yes and it's not us or the federal

1292
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:22,710
government this is the public health

1293
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,930
system in Canada so that is their

1294
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:27,089
capacity so they can ramp up if there's

1295
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:30,990
a cluster that needed to be tested

1296
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:33,569
of course this capacity is distributed

1297
01:00:33,569 --> 01:00:36,329
across the country if there is a

1298
01:00:36,329 --> 01:00:38,700
particular area of country where let's

1299
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,349
say you in northern Saskatchewan you get

1300
01:00:40,349 --> 01:00:42,690
an outbreak the key is that we will

1301
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:45,240
support whichever jurisdiction was

1302
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,000
searched if they need that too so that's

1303
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,250
that's really important because the

1304
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,619
capacity is easier to reach if you were

1305
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:55,230
closer to the biggest centers we are

1306
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:57,839
going to be sort of supporting the more

1307
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:01,470
remote areas but even the point-of-care

1308
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:03,420
test is a machine you have to be trained

1309
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,369
to how to use that but they can be

1310
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:07,410
deployed they can be reinforced so that

1311
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,119
what you brought up is a really

1312
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:11,220
important point if you spot the case in

1313
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:13,260
the contest if there's a cluster you got

1314
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,460
to move in really fast

1315
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:17,430
and the laboratory capacity is designed

1316
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:19,740
to be able to do that ok and we have all

1317
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,869
the supplies and stuff ready to go in

1318
01:01:21,869 --> 01:01:23,970
case this is this hat this has happens

1319
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:27,539
tomorrow or a month from now yes so I

1320
01:01:27,539 --> 01:01:30,270
thought this moment I know that there's

1321
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,029
enough supplies but as you know every

1322
01:01:33,029 --> 01:01:35,940
day all those situations could change

1323
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,640
and we work every single day to make

1324
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,109
sure that we have what we need

1325
01:01:40,109 --> 01:01:43,770
so that is the capacity that we have but

1326
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,839
that doesn't mean that tomorrow I may

1327
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:48,289
not tell you that there's a potential

1328
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:52,529
issue or something but the good news is

1329
01:01:52,529 --> 01:01:55,049
that there's more more capacity and

1330
01:01:55,049 --> 01:01:57,859
there's more more domestic capacity

1331
01:01:57,859 --> 01:02:00,329
thank you system offender confirms the

1332
01:02:00,329 --> 01:02:02,960
pathology

1333
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:06,750
you
