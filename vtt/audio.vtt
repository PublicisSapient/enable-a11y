00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.640
 [Music]

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.840
 Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.400
 The shadow knows.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.200
 [Laughter]

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:40.240
 [Music]

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.040
 The shadow, mysterious character who aids the forces of law and order,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.200
 is in reality Lamont Cranston, wealthy young man of outstanding talent.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.400
 As the shadow, Cranston is gifted with hypnotic power to cloud men's minds

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.720
 so that they cannot see him. Cranston's friend and companion,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.800
 the lovely Margo Lane, is the only person who knows to whom the voice of the

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.120
 invisible shadow belongs. Today's story, the voice of death.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:16.880
 [Music]

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.080
 Sam. Yes, Annie. You almost finished reading your paper?

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.640
 Yes, Annie. Time to go to bed, ain't it? Yes, Annie.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.040
 Better make sure all the windows are shut. Sounds like a real mean storm

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.880
 coming up. Yes, Annie.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.840
 Sam. Yes, Annie. Did you hear that? What? You hear it?

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.200
 Sounded just like little kittens. Yeah. Well, I wonder where they come from.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.640
 Well, they're poor things, outdoors on a night like this.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.880
 Sam, will you go out and find them? Go on, will you? No, Annie, you don't...

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.120
 Just listen to them little critters. Ain't you got no heart, Sam?

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.680
 Oh, all right. Where's my raincoat now? Oh, here you are.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.360
 I'll set up a little box for them by the fire.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.640
 All right, all right. Now stop your crying, kittens. I'm coming.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.320
 Just wait. I'll eat up a bit of milk, too.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.840
 Do you see him, Sam? No, not yet. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Annie, how do you do?

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.760
 Sam, what's wrong? What in the name of all this fooling?

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.880
 Sam! Sam, what is it? Sam, what happened?

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.800
 Sam, blood. You're all covered with blood.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:49.760
 Sam, how could kittens do... Sam! He's dead.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:03:00.800
 Well, I must say, Lamont, that we picked a fine day to go visiting.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.880
 You are no secret, Margot. I'm your man. This whole thing is just in effect.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.200
 Huh? At that day? Uh-huh. People always look for a mysterious atmosphere

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.520
 in the Louisiana bios, so Mother Nature very obligingly provides for them.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.880
 I see. Well, I must say that sunshine wouldn't make a great deal of difference.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.360
 I don't see how it could ever penetrate those moth-laden trees.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.080
 Is it much further to go, Lamont? I don't think so.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.520
 Arthur told me the house was exactly five miles from that last bridge.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.480
 Why in the world would anyone want to live way off like this?

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.320
 Well, the house has been in Arthur Whittington's family for many, many years,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.600
 and Arthur being a rather peculiar chap, I don't suppose it bothers him in the least.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.880
 Oh, forgive me for appearing dull, but I don't get it.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.120
 Well, Margot, it's a long story. It began in college when we took a medical course together.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.640
 I guess I was the only person in the whole school who really understood him.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.200
 And why was that? Well, Arthur was a brilliant student,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.000
 but he was also a highly sensitive lad, always imagining that people were making fun of him,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.040
 laughing at him behind his back. Was there any reason for that?

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.560
 Well, yes, there was. It was his voice. He had the harshest sounding voice I'd ever heard.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.000
 It cracked. It rasped. It did everything that a voice shouldn't do.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.280
 Really? In fact, it was his voice that made him leave medical school.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.280
 I don't follow you, Lamont. Well, it all happened one day in class.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.160
 Arthur had prepared a paper, an excellent paper that he had to read aloud to the student body.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.800
 Gentlemen, gentlemen, please, please. You may proceed, Mr. Whittington.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.560
 Now, Mr. Whittington, where are you going? Wait, why are you leaving the classroom?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.440
 Well, he threw down his paper and walked right out of the room.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:53.440
 Oh, the poor boy. I have never heard of him since.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.800
 But we've corresponded. And then, as you know,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.120
 when he learned that we were down here in Louisiana fishing,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.600
 he got in touch with me and invited us out to see him.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.440
 Well, that goes a long way toward explaining his living out here so far from civilization.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.200
 You know, he still must be sensitive about that horrible voice.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.040
 Yes, I'm sure he is. But remember, we mustn't do anything to call attention to it.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.920
 Oh, heavens no, I wouldn't. Lamont, there's something right ahead on the road.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.880
 Yes, Martha, yes, I see it.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:24.080
 This rain on the windshield is hard to... wait, it's some sort of a fence.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.720
 Well, it looks like we've reached the end of the line, and not a house in sight.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.280
 There seems to be a sign on it. We'd better get out and investigate.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.200
 Button up that raincoat, Martha. Oh, don't worry.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.880
 Well, it's getting so dark, it can hardly make the sign out.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.720
 Here's your flashlight, Lamont. Oh, thank you.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.560
 There we are. Well, Whittington Hall, keep out.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.560
 That's a nice welcome. Oh, I'm sure that doesn't mean that.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.400
 Well, looks like we'll have to walk down this path to get to the house.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.800
 I think I can just see it through the trees.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.000
 Lamont, did you hear that? Yes, sounds like little kittens.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.760
 Oh, they're poor things out in weather like this. I'm going to find them.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.040
 They seem to be under that bush. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.240
 Margot, you'll get no climbing around in that underbrush.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.320
 Well, I'll have them in just a minute. Margot!

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.120
 Come on, come here quickly! Margot, what in the nick...

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.960
 Dog! Giant dog! Help me, Lamont!

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.040
 Get down, you! Get down! Get down!

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.280
 Run for it, Margot! This car will get you!

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.760
 Get down, you! Get down!

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.440
 There, downing away. Margot, are you all right?

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.040
 Yes, I guess so. They didn't hurt you?

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.000
 No, one of them ripped my coat, that's all. Lamont, I don't understand.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.800
 They sounded like little kittens. Yes, yes, I know.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.520
 Well, what do you make of it, Lamont? I don't know, but one thing is certain.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.280
 They're going back to the car and get my revolver.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:07:03.200
 Lamont, I've never seen such an eerie-looking house in my life.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.400
 The broken shutters and the crumbled stairs and the unpainted walls.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.800
 Don't tell me that this is the Whittington Mansion.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.320
 I guess it is, Margot. Yes, we're back in New Orleans.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.720
 Well, if you'd rather we... I know we've come this far.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.160
 Go ahead and knock at the door. I promise you, if a ghost answers,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.520
 I won't be surprised. No, frankly, nor will I.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.280
 Are you going to tell Mr. Whittington about the dogs?

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.520
 Of course. Why not? Well, it may sound a bit strange in the telling.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.560
 Dogs that sound like little kittens. Well, he may know who's...

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.120
 What do you want? Oh, good evening.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.920
 We'd like to see Mr. Whittington, please. What is it about?

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.280
 He's expecting. There are no guests expected here tonight.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.240
 Well, if you say that Miss Lane and Mr. Cranston are here...

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.200
 I tell you that Mr. Whittington is not seeing anyone tonight.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.360
 Jasper! Jasper, what is it?

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.280
 People here, Mr. Arthur. Oh, Arthur!

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.240
 It's Lamont Cranston. Lamont, come in. Come in.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.840
 Jasper, you old fool, I told you we were expecting Mr. Cranston.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.320
 Sorry, Mr. Arthur. Come in, sir, please.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.560
 Well, Lamont, I'm glad you were able to come. It's good seeing you again.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.760
 Well, thank you, Arthur. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Miss Lane.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.160
 This is Arthur Whittington, Margot. How do you do, Mr. Lane?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.280
 How do you do, Mr. Whittington?

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.200
 Well, come, take off those wet coats.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.000
 Yes, we're more or less swimming in these.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.040
 Jasper, show Miss Lane and Mr. Cranston into the living room.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.200
 There's a fire there, Lamont. You can dry off.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.760
 Oh, the comforts of home. Yes.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.800
 Now, if you'll excuse me for a moment, I'll go and arrange for dinner.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.520
 Oh, yes, yes, of course. You will come this way, please.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:33.920
 Thank you.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.800
 Lamont, this place is just as scary inside as it was outdoors.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.040
 Yes, I see what you mean.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:47.120
 Those muscle walls and that borne furniture and candles and old-fashioned lamps.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.960
 I don't understand how anyone can live here.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.240
 There's something else that's more difficult to understand, Margot.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:54.800
 What do you mean?

00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.400
 That man that greeted us was Arthur Whittington, but it was not Whittington's voice.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:07.920
 No, no, Lamont. I saved this wine for special occasions.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.480
 Very special occasions.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.160
 Well, we're flattered.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.880
 I suppose my mode of living is a bit mystifying to you, Miss Lane.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.520
 Mystifying?

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.400
 Well, my staying here in the wilderness, in a house that's almost in ruins,

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.600
 living alone with just a servant.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.640
 Well, I think it might have its advantages, too.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.440
 Well, I'm glad to hear you say that. Some people might not understand.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.840
 I must say, though, Arthur, for a man who's roughing it, you set a highly civilized table.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.000
 Well, I'm like a Britisher in the tropics, I guess. I still like to maintain order.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.880
 Master Arthur.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.160
 What is it, Jasper?

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.280
 Why are you interrupting my meal?

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.720
 Master, they are loose again.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.360
 What?

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.800
 I told you to keep that door locked.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.080
 I know, I know, but they got out.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.880
 You fool.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.280
 They must be someplace near. I keep hearing them.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.800
 Excuse me, please, Miss Lane.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.920
 Lamont, I'll be right back.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.720
 Come along, Jasper.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.200
 Yes.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.240
 Oh, don't mind us.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.680
 Lamont, you know they're worse people.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.880
 What's all this about?

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.640
 I'm not sure, Margot, but it could be those savage dogs.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.520
 Lamont, do you think they belong to Mr. Whittington?

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:09.920
 Perhaps.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:15.600
 You know, I'm letting you in on a little secret. I wish we could leave here.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.720
 Well, why, Margot?

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:22.880
 Well, the way Arthur Whittington acts, the way he talks, the way he looks at you.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.640
 I don't know, it just sends shivers up my back.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.640
 But we can't leave now. Not until this storm is over with, anyway.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.240
 Well, I certainly wish that they'd never...

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.560
 Lamont, do you hear that?

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.040
 Yes, that same sound. They're near the house this time.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.880
 Why should he have such beasts around here?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.200
 And how do they get the voice of a cat?

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.840
 That's something we'll find out when Arthur returns. I'll just go...

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.600
 What was that?

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.200
 It was a human voice.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.000
 It sounded like it came from someplace here in the house.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.320
 Yes.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.720
 Oh, I don't like this place, Lamont.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.920
 When he comes back, I think we should ask for an explanation.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.360
 I think we should know about those dogs and that moaning, too.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.400
 Yes, when Arthur returns...

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.320
 I have returned, Lamont.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.000
 I didn't hear you come in.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.880
 What was that about, my returning, Lamont?

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.280
 Well, Arthur, both Margo and myself are very curious to learn something

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.480
 about two giant dogs that we encountered on our way in here.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.520
 Yes, what about them?

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.720
 Well, we wondered just how it was possible

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.080
 that these huge animals had the vocal chords of tiny kittens.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.560
 Oh, Lamont, I shouldn't have given you that last glass of wine.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.040
 No, but it's true. I saw and heard them, too.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.400
 Oh, now come, Miss Lane.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.200
 I'd say your imaginations were working overtime.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.520
 Who is that, Arthur?

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:37.760
 What?

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.920
 Oh, what are you talking about?

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.800
 Do you hear it?

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.280
 That voice.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.280
 Someone in this house.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:43.920
 Arthur, we've got to...

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.160
 Yes.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.240
 Yes, I know.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.800
 Now that you've heard him, I...

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.680
 I'll have to explain his presence.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.400
 Well, who is it?

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.960
 Why did he cry out like that?

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.400
 Miss Lane, that was a cousin of mine, Frank Harper.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.040
 He's in one of the rooms off this corridor.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.360
 He's locked in that room because...

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.800
 Well, because he's not right mentally.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.560
 I'm sorry you had to learn about this.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.320
 Family skeletons are never a very pleasant topic.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.680
 Harper!

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.000
 Yes, you see, my dear cousin Harper,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 I've gotten rid of my shell at last.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.400
 Oh.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:20.960
 And now...

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.560
 Get out of here, do you hear me?

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.520
 No, I won't.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.480
 Help me, you two.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:24.880
 Help me.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.920
 He can't keep me here like this.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.040
 Look, we'll get back to your room.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.920
 No, no, let me go.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.720
 Take it easy, Arthur.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.000
 I must handle this in my own way.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.800
 Don't let him take me back.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.120
 Help me.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.240
 Shut up, you fool.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:32.960
 Come in here with me.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.000
 No, no.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.400
 Amon.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.200
 Oh, Amon, that was horrible.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.280
 Yes, and it was also very revealing.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.640
 What do you mean?

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.160
 The voice of that man, Harper,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.560
 is the same one that used to belong to Arthur Whittington.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.400
 Amon, what does all this mean?

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.520
 I don't know yet, Margo.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.600
 Someway, somehow, that poor creature that rushed in here

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.040
 has been given Whittington's voice.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.280
 Listen, the animals again.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.600
 Yes, they're part of this thing, too.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.640
 This mix-up of voices.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.880
 Amon, I wish we could leave here right now.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.240
 We can't go now, Margo.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.840
 Not until we learn what's behind all this.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.280
 Amon, what's happening up there?

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.040
 Sounds as if Harper's being beaten.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.680
 Come on, Margo.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.120
 We're going to that room.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.160
 What are you going to do?

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.360
 I want to talk to that boy.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.600
 Quietly, Margo.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.680
 We must get down the hall without Whittington hearing us.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.120
 What is he doing to him?

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.620
 Quiet.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.440
 The room is right down here.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.360
 Are you going in there?

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:39.860
 Not yet.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.840
 Not until Whittington leaves.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.480
 I want to talk to the boy alone.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.240
 Perhaps I'd better wait in the living room.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:46.880
 Well...

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.560
 If Whittington wants to know where you are,

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.280
 I can tell him that you've gone out to the car for something.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.320
 Very well, Margo.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.400
 Please, Lamont, please don't be long.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:54.900
 I won't.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.600
 The answer to this mystery will be found very quickly by the shadow.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:08.800
 That'll teach you not to go running around this house.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.600
 Now you stay here and be quiet, understand?

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.560
 Either you obey me in the future...

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.240
 Good night, my dear cousin.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.280
 Harper.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.880
 Oh, what was that?

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.720
 I've come here to help you, Mr. Harper.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.040
 Hearing things...

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.200
 I'm hearing things again!

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:33.840
 No, you're not.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.640
 Who speaks to me?

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.520
 I am called...

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.280
 The Shadow.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.680
 I see no one.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.520
 I'm standing right here beside you.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.000
 But you can't see me because I've used my hypnotic power to cloud your vision.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.160
 I don't understand.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:50.960
 Listen to me, Harper.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.800
 I'm here to help you get out.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.840
 But first...

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.120
 I must learn something from you.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.800
 You'll help me?

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.680
 Yes, yes.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.240
 But tell me...

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.920
 Why are you here?

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.880
 Why has your cousin kept you locked in this room?

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.840
 He's jealous of me.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.520
 He always has been.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.960
 How did he get you into this house?

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.760
 I came to visit.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.520
 Just like that couple I saw in the dining room tonight.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.440
 But I never got out.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.520
 They never will either.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.240
 Why do you say that?

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.200
 He will use them just as he used me.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.120
 For his devilish work.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.200
 Why was your cousin jealous of you?

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.400
 My voice.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.920
 Yes?

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.200
 What about your voice?

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.400
 I used to have the voice that Arthur has now.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.360
 I knew it!

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:31.920
 I knew it!

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.840
 What did he do?

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.760
 How did he accomplish this transference?

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.040
 He came to my house one night.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.400
 Had dinner.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.780
 Dinner.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.360
 I felt drowsy.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.040
 I'd been drunk.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:43.920
 Yes? Then what happened?

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.140
 Well...

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.040
 When I came to, I was...

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.520
 I was in his laboratory.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.040
 He has a laboratory here in the house?

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:51.540
 Yes.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.280
 I was strapped to a table.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.000
 I fought to get loose, but it wasn't any use.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.600
 Only clamped an ether cone on my face.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.680
 I blast out.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.800
 And when you came to?

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.600
 When I came to...

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.240
 Oh, it must have been days later.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.080
 I had his voice.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.920
 This horrible voice of his.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.200
 And he had mine.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.200
 And you've been kept prisoner here ever since?

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:13.920
 Yes, yes.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.280
 Always in this cell.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.320
 In the same cell.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.560
 Even the dogs get out.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.400
 Those savage dogs that he...

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.240
 Gave the voices of little kittens.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.200
 Oh, I see.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.600
 That accounts for the dogs.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.400
 Well, I promise you this, Mr. Harper.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.320
 You shall be free to leave this cell of yours after tonight.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:42.080
 Is that you, Lamont?

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.220
 No.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.200
 I'm sorry.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.240
 Oh, Mr. Fullington.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.200
 Where is Lamont?

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.120
 Well, he went out to the car for something.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.320
 He should be right back.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:52.820
 I see.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:57.360
 Well, perhaps you'd like me to show you your room while we're waiting.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.080
 Oh, no, thanks.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:58.880
 That's all right.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:16:59.760
 I'll wait for him.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.080
 I'd rather you come with me now, if you will.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.480
 I have several chores to perform.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.640
 And I'd just like you to know where your room is.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.940
 Very well.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.320
 Just down this hall, Miss Lane.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:12.820
 Thank you.

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:16.480
 I think you'll be very interested in what I have to show you.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.760
 This will be your room.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.040
 Won't you step inside?

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:21.540
 All right.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.360
 Is there a light that I can...

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.120
 What are you doing?

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.600
 I'm just making sure that no one will disturb us, Miss Lane.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.720
 Why did you lock that door?

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.220
 You'll see.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.440
 Now we'll put on this lamp.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.140
 There.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.660
 It's true.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.480
 What is this place?

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.120
 This is my laboratory, Miss Lane.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.520
 My workshop, where I conduct my experiments.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.360
 Let me out of here and unlock that door at once.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.360
 I'm sorry, but you're staying here.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.720
 If you don't let me out, I'll call for help.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.920
 Lamont will hear me.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.880
 Why don't you call?

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.520
 Lamont!

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.020
 Lamont!

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.800
 Before you continue, Miss Lane,

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.320
 you might be interested to learn that these walls are completely soundproof.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.440
 Why are you doing this?

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.720
 Why have you got me here?

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.240
 You're going to help them, Miss Lane.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.120
 Help you?

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:01.620
 Yes.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.640
 They're going to be a party to an experiment of mine.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.360
 My greatest experiment.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.320
 What do you mean?

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.440
 You'll learn soon enough.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.480
 First, I'm afraid I must strap you to this tablecloth.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.040
 No!

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.000
 Don't give away to me!

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.200
 Stop being such an obstinate fool!

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.000
 No, don't do this!

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.240
 Lamont, Lamont!

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.680
 Stop pounding on that door!

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.640
 Let go of me!

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.240
 You come with me now.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:22.880
 Oh!

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.680
 On this table.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.120
 No, you can't do this!

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:25.920
 There you are.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.520
 Let me go, let me go!

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.760
 Now a few slaps to hold you securely.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.040
 No, let me loose!

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:31.840
 There we are.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.860
 Now.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.520
 Now you can struggle or scream as much as you wish.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.240
 I'd particularly recommend the scream.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.160
 It may be your last chance to use it.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:42.720
 What do you mean?

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.120
 This experiment of mine has to do with your voice, Miss Lane.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.400
 That's my work, you know.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.720
 The transference of voices.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.760
 What are you saying?

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.600
 You've already heard two of my examples.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.480
 The dogs with the voices of little kittens.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.040
 And my cousin, Frank Harper.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.080
 And it's true.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.600
 What Lamont thought is true.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.440
 Oh, so he gets my secret, eh?

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.440
 Well, he'll never live to tell it.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.000
 Oh, no.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.440
 You will survive, though.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.560
 But you won't be able to tell it either, Miss Lane.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.560
 What are you going to do to him?

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.120
 I'll show you.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.240
 The answer to your question is in this box.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.000
 Let me open it.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.240
 There we are.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.480
 A cat!

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.200
 Yes, a cat.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.520
 Have you ever seen a more beautiful cat?

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.480
 She's pure poison, aren't you, girl?

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.440
 What has that cat got to do with me?

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.080
 A great deal.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.800
 I'm giving her your vocal cords.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.520
 No.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.560
 No, you don't know what you're doing.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.040
 You're lying.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:37.540
 Not at all.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:41.280
 I merely have a great hatred, Miss Lane, for the entire human race.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.560
 They ruin me.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.880
 Their heartless cruelty blighted my entire life.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:51.040
 But animals, ah, you're different, aren't you, my little pet?

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.680
 Lamont, you can't mean what you say.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.320
 But I do.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.800
 Lady knows that, don't you, girl?

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.280
 She knows that after tonight, we'll be able to converse.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.720
 Be able to tell one another all the things that we've kept stored up.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.200
 No, you can't.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.080
 You can't do this.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:11.520
 And you, Miss Lane, as befits your sex, you will have the vocal cords of a cat.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.080
 No.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:12.640
 No.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.160
 Now I think we can proceed with these.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.280
 No, keep away.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.000
 Keep away.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.200
 There will be no pain.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.960
 Miss Skeeter will take care of that.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.680
 Are you ready?

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.320
 No, please.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.160
 No, she isn't ready, Mr. Whittington.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.120
 Who was that?

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:23.840
 Who spoke?

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.720
 I spoke to you.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.240
 Who are you?

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.920
 I am called the Shadow.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.880
 Don't try to find me.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.680
 I've made myself quite invisible to your eyes.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.560
 What are you doing here?

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.640
 Why are you interrupting my work?

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.480
 I've come to put an end to your work.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.000
 I'm here to free that young woman.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.440
 Oh, no, no, you won't.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.360
 I'm not frightened by someone I can't even see.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.560
 Put down that ether.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.080
 I'm going ahead with my work.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:44.960
 No, no.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.000
 You may not be able to see me, Mr. Whittington, but I think you'll feel this.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.240
 Why, you.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.760
 Now I'm releasing this girl.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.400
 And then I'm holding you until I can get the police out here.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.240
 They'll be very interested in your experiments.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.240
 You think you can keep me here, do you?

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.280
 The light.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.000
 Put out the light.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.880
 Now, Mr. Shadow, I am invisible too.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.480
 And I'm getting out of here right now.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.280
 Stop it.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.320
 He's going to locate me.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.280
 Come back here, Whittington.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.040
 Come and get me, Shadow.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:09.760
 Come on, Margo.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.120
 He's not getting away.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.480
 There he is, crossing the lawn.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.840
 He's evidently trying to get to our car.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.920
 Look, Margo.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.760
 There's two figures running after Whittington.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.320
 It's the dog.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.360
 The giant dog.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.480
 They're chasing him, Lamont.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.840
 Oh, they're tearing him to pieces.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.720
 Why didn't you have a gun?

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.480
 Oh, Lamont, can't you do something for him?

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.080
 I'm not prepared for doing something for you, Margo.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.200
 There's hundreds of them surrounding you.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.320
 Quick, back to the house.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.680
 Oh, they're coming after us, Lamont.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.560
 I'll never face them.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.760
 All right, you stand still, Margo.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.320
 Don't move.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.120
 I'll take care of them.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:48.800
 Well, now that we see that Mr. Hawthorne is in good hands,

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.480
 I don't mind playing.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.880
 I'm certainly glad to be leaving that place, Lamont.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.600
 You do know such interesting people.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.760
 Well, you can't say they're dull.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.000
 No.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.960
 Did you tell the police about the dogs?

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.280
 Yes.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.360
 They've destroyed them.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.600
 And Whittington's body is being removed to town.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.920
 You know something, Lamont?

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.160
 What?

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.600
 Whenever I see an alley cat from now on,

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:21.600
 I'll think to myself, "There, but for the grace of the shadow, go I."

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:37.680
 The weed of crime bears bitter fruit.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.480
 Crime does not pay.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:49.840
 The shadow knows.
