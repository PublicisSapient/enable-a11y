00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.820
lore'l certain situational comedy for

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.270
all copper grab that owner target while

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.279
you can

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:05.550
Maxie okay maybe so maybe my next one

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.180
would be for you dr. Tam so so what

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.060
exactly has changed for you now to say

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.670
we recommend because you were saying

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.470
that the mask does not protect the

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.779
person that was wearing it I am assuming

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:21.930
that this is still the case so what has

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.300
changed for you now to go the extra step

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.630
and not just say this is a good idea

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.450
this can be done now it is we recommend

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.740
that you do this mm-hmm yep so that's

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.330
it's a specific recommendation if you

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.520
like are supposed to be I think the

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.670
previous language was more permissive so

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.510
I think just to rewind a little bit the

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.720
chief medical officers position from the

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.120
start was that of course these masts

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.899
protect others so if you're wearing it

00:09:54.899 --> 00:09:57.540
you're protecting other people against

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.560
your droplets so at the start it was put

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.970
obviously someone who is sick who is

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.279
coughing or sneezing if they're going to

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:07.320
go out or have to go to a medical

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.779
appointment for example they need to

00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:12.300
cover the calf and and with facial

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.640
covering or mass that is for the sick

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.540
person so it's when we got more evidence

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.350
about asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.600
individuals and that although we don't

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.910
fully understand their role in

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.550
transmission it is an added layer of

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.400
protection even for people who don't

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.860
have symptoms to wear masks to prevent

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.910
transmission to others and even though

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.890
the evidence space hasn't changed too

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.850
much and particularly as people have

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.440
generally been staying at home

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.020
particularly and now that we are sort of

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.560
reopening or restarting a lot of the

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.649
activities the chief McArthur's felt

00:10:55.649 --> 00:10:59.790
that they can recommend this for people

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.920
who cannot maintain that 2 meter

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.700
distance and more specifically if of

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.080
course if there's virus in your

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.960
there's been a community transmission in

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.320
your jurisdiction and I start a new said

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.380
you know jurisdictions felt that they

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.140
need to do that risk assessment because

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.760
there's some provinces and territories

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.280
that haven't had community transmission

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.220
and others have clearly have and

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.860
continues to have community transmission

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.930
activities so they will do the

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.360
individual risk assessments in terms of

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.270
the various specific recommendations

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:40.060
locally but I think you know from our

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.680
perspective it is an added layer of

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.960
protection it is for you to protect

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.360
others so if two people are in Mass I'm

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.460
protecting you and you're protecting me

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:52.210
and so I think as more people do go out

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.410
in the community you can imagine

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:54.760
there'll be more people on public

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.700
transport or maybe more people some of

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.420
the retail stores are beginning to open

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.760
for example and if you can't predict

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.470
whether you can maintain that to me the

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.170
distance then is recommended that you

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.330
wear the non-medical masks or facial

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.170
covering merci docteur next next

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.580
question operator thank you the next

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.920
question is from Mike Blanche field from

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:26.530
The Canadian Press please go ahead yeah

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.780
hi I guess this is a question for dr.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.960
Tam we've seen radically different

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.330
approaches in the provinces to largest

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.440
provinces Ontario Quebec on reopening

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.000
you know especially when it comes to

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.620
schooling especially and we heard what

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.780
Dark Lord said yesterday how do you

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.900
explain the differences an approach to

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.030
reopening easing of restrictions and

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.690
these two highly afflicted Canada to

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:58.600
largest provinces so at the federal

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.630
level and working with the provinces

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.650
essentially the chief medical officers

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.960
we we have provided guidance and

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.140
criteria but obviously the provinces

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.250
want to retain their own ability to

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:16.780
adjust their approaches as I think even

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.920
in the global context I don't know that

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.220
there's

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.459
absolute white halfway down this curve

00:13:24.459 --> 00:13:27.129
as I've said people have to do whatever

00:13:27.129 --> 00:13:30.819
they do cautiously and slowly using the

00:13:30.819 --> 00:13:33.129
best information they have in their own

00:13:33.129 --> 00:13:36.670
particular contexts and that if they

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.629
were you know reopening or loosening

00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:44.050
certain measures they need to have the

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.420
necessary systems to detect whether that

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.269
has led to and the increase in cases or

00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:52.540
clusters so I think whatever pathway

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.750
down this curve there is no

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.569
one-size-fits-all and there is a certain

00:13:58.569 --> 00:14:01.660
element of uncertainty but if you do it

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.850
more cautiously and monitor it and

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:07.889
adjust as needed that is the key

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:15.129
principle thank you follow-up all right

00:14:15.129 --> 00:14:17.410
well how do you square the differences

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:18.879
anyway I mean there are two very similar

00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:21.689
provinces similar sets of circumstances

00:14:21.689 --> 00:14:24.310
does it surprise you from a scientific

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.769
point of view that two extremely

00:14:26.769 --> 00:14:28.389
different conclusions can be reached

00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:31.920
under these circumstances well I think

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:37.209
as the local jurisdictions one aspect

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:39.730
which are not sure is particularly

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.860
evident is that I think Public Health is

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.980
also trying to take a holistic approach

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.629
not just balancing these are the

00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:48.939
effective public health measures but

00:14:48.939 --> 00:14:52.059
also looking at the negative

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:54.879
consequences as well you need to have

00:14:54.879 --> 00:14:56.579
some balance you need to bring back

00:14:56.579 --> 00:15:00.639
certain activities and certain measures

00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:02.980
getting people outside for instance the

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.790
outside is less risk because we know

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.529
transmission generally occurs and

00:15:08.529 --> 00:15:10.720
particularly transmission to large

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.079
numbers people occurs indoors and so I

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:15.850
think all of those has to be taken to

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.480
account but in some areas there may be a

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.540
good reason why certain things are being

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.629
opened and in order to support the

00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:27.910
community in their local context as well

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.449
and it's a balance between the need to

00:15:31.449 --> 00:15:34.029
reduce the spread of disease compared to

00:15:34.029 --> 00:15:35.110
all the other

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.420
from a health social and economic

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.850
perspective it's afternoon I guess we

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.380
would add that even and with any

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.880
province you can see their differences

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.170
because obviously the provincial

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.390
authorities know more what's happening

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.130
on the ground dr. Tam and myself they

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.780
have the data they know what's what's

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.310
actually happening on the ground and so

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.990
we can see in the province of Quebec

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.270
that what's happening on the island of

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.930
Montreal and how they may be relaxing

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.090
their measures a you know maybe in a

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.650
slower fashion based on the epidemiology

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.150
of what's happening in one trellis

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:05.470
compared to the rest of the province of

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.360
Quebec that's that's a prime example

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.400
that even with any province that there

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.500
needs to be a careful look at obviously

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.120
taking account what's happening locally

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.610
to make the best possible decisions

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.010
based on what what they know in terms of

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.590
the epidemiology thank you thank you

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:25.120
upper next question Thank You Missy the

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.850
portion disco madness tell the developer

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:32.410
to move hi dr. Tim my question is for

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.480
you I think I have an idea of the answer

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.000
but I would like to hear you explain why

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.580
is your recommendation today on non

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.170
surgical masks why is it only a

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.020
recommendation and why are you not

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.990
making it mandatory canada-wide to wear

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.810
a mask when we go outside is it a

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.910
question of jurisdiction is it a

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.680
question of their just wouldn't be

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.590
enough masks to make it mandatory is it

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.410
a question of Rights can you explain why

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.860
it remains only a recommendation it's

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.480
like the National OVA remains a

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.690
recommendation and asks the meta causes

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.550
of health needs to look at their own

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.430
particular context in terms of whether

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.010
they actually have evidence of community

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.290
transmission and some areas actually

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.540
don't and have actually never had

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.310
community transmission it's very

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.130
different from say maybe you know

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.869
compare doctor news at comparing

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:30.760
Montreal and Toronto to Yukon or the PEI

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.010
might actually be very different so they

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.560
need that ability to make those

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.510
recommendations their public

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.160
transportation systems might be

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.670
different for example and so they they

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.860
need the ability to do that risk

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.950
assessment and recommend it from from

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:48.550
their

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.700
- from the federal perspective and

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.980
Transport Canada of course given that

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:58.060
the federal jurisdiction did make with

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.650
the wearing of non-medical masks

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:06.040
mandatory on those conveniences so that

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.370
is within the federal jurisdiction its

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.530
doctrine you maybe I just add certainly

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.240
understand that the interest in terms of

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.130
the use of a non-medical mask you know

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.050
by the general public but one of the

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.480
issues were also obviously with our

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.980
counterparts and provinces and

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.510
territories looking at closely is that

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.240
the unintended consequences where if you

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.580
people think that by wearing a mask in

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.350
public they don't need to follow all of

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.610
the other important public health

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.890
measures that we've been underlining uh

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:34.690
so many times in terms of guarding you

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.340
know that the distance of physical

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.950
distancing of 2 meters etc so that's one

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:40.120
of the things I think we still need to

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.290
underline that this is quote a

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.060
supplementary measure that people can

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.950
use to protect themselves when it's

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.110
difficult to maintain that physical

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.940
distancing of 2 meters but it certainly

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.550
does not replace all of the other good

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:57.490
measures such as hand-washing etc thanks

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.130
another follow-up - sorry there's an

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.430
echo as a follow-up dr. Tim so that as

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.350
you mentioned previously it was already

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.900
suggested to wear a non-medical mask

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.970
when we go outside now it's recommended

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.580
but in in places like Quebec for example

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.290
it has been recommended strongly

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.080
recommended for a week already and we

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.200
see that people are not necessarily

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.700
wearing it outside at the grocery store

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.460
or in other locations where they can't

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.520
social distance so what exactly can you

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.760
do as public health officials to ensure

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.010
that something actually changes on the

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.110
ground your language is changing but

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:40.240
people aren't wearing it more I can't

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.610
speak to the very local jurisdiction and

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:46.840
they will adjust their approach as

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:51.340
needed but I think from certain public

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.040
opinion research etc Canadians are

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.570
wearing more masks and they are more

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.520
that the social cultural shift is

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.840
beginning to occur

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.450
so part of what public health is doing

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:08.020
is you know the concept is one I think

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:14.560
of reciprocal protection so I think for

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.140
Canadians thinking of it as I'm

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.080
protecting you and you're protecting me

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.100
is a very key concept we have to gain

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.430
the trust of the Canadian public and get

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:32.230
their buy-in to do all of this mandating

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.630
is one measure which some jurisdictions

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.380
might take if they have to but for the

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.490
most part I do think that the shift is

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.840
occurring in the population as well

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.800
which I think is is great thank you

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.360
doctor will now turn to the room first

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.730
question yeah

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:52.960
Ryan Templeton with the National Post

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.840
the pan Canadian Public Health Care

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.540
Network which you're chair of wrote a

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.300
report in 2016 called a blueprint for a

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.770
federated system of Public Health

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.280
surveillance it recommended that

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.840
provinces and the feds work closer

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.520
together it said there were gaps and how

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.290
they share data said there were

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.360
differences in how they collect data I'm

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.490
wondering sort of what progress has been

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.890
made on implementing that reports

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.260
recommendations to a more aligned system

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.180
between the provinces and the federal

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:26.790
government yes so I think data is

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.770
extremely important obviously to any

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:34.120
outbreak and you know pandemic is into

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.230
this scale from a regular outbreak

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.850
perspective we have some very well run

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.470
mechanisms your foodborne outbreaks

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.170
being a very key concept of this is that

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.190
we react very fast information is shared

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.360
and but

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.730
but something of this scale and the

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.820
respiratory domain that's obviously some

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.190
gaps particularly reporting to the

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.350
national level that we do have to

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.630
address some of it is timeliness but

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.510
some of the fields cannot be completed

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.330
by the jurisdictions at the moment when

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.640
we look at the completion rates so we

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.010
are actively trying very hard to figure

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:13.960
out where what is needed is it more

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.370
support

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.140
at different levels is that can the

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.160
system be made more efficient because

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.360
efficiency in the system helps our

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.640
frontline public health workers as well

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.500
who are very busy doing certain things

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.590
that the sister there may be system

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.660
efficiencies of course the day that

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.700
comes from many different areas and it's

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.530
the complexity of the Canadian landscape

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.510
of data I think some data has to come

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.760
from hospitals they come from labs it

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.320
has to come from local public health

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.600
units and that so but I think it is

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.240
absolutely recognized and also at the

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.870
First Minister's level that this is an

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.059
absolutely another chance for us to

00:22:55.059 --> 00:23:00.040
improve on what we're doing but you know

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:05.080
I think capitalizing on the sort of

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.230
crisis that we have we need to give it

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.490
an another good go for the next piece

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.320
thank you follow-up yeah I'm wondering

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.420
what were those what are sort of the

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.850
barriers in bringing this data together

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.820
is it jurisdictional is it the provinces

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.830
don't want to ease up on their control

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:26.380
over health care and also do you think

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.510
not having shared data has hindered our

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.620
ability to respond to this pandemic so

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.460
we it is a federated system and the

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.380
public health system is a local level up

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:42.670
system and we collaborate to get data so

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.950
that's always been the construct is one

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:49.030
of a collaborative approach and so the

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.830
most important thing of course is at the

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.870
local level they have the data that they

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.080
need to actually respond to the

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.520
identification of cases and the

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.980
follow-up of contacts which we all know

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.660
is very important that's the key

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.510
so then is the reporting then from the

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.460
local jurisdiction to the provincial

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:11.650
level that has to be sort of that is

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.330
under the jurisdiction of the provinces

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.300
and territories from the province to the

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.360
federal level is we at the federal level

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.760
don't do the day-to-day case management

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.750
that the data is needed and the data is

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.210
useful to the local drinks and they have

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:29.020
been action

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.230
they have been providing advise public

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:33.820
health advice based on the local level

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.880
information but it is important to get

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.100
the national picture and to be able to

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:44.140
provide that to policymakers as well so

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.400
I think we have the basic information in

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.910
but I think what people needed and it's

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:54.070
asking for now is more what we call this

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:58.990
aggregation more in-depth analysis we

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:03.010
have things that age or sex but there is

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:06.750
a need to have First Nations Inuit matey

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.929
data as well as race ethnicity base data

00:25:10.929 --> 00:25:12.970
as well so those are the kind of things

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:14.800
that we need to work on because if

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.500
you're fine-tuning your policies to

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.780
support vulnerable populations that's

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.880
important we do know of course we have

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:27.130
data for example to provide measures or

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.260
policies or programs to those most at

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:32.110
risk which is the seniors and the people

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.210
with underlying medical conditions etc

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.130
so that those the kind of data is

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.500
available is driving the response right

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.179
now as you can see in the different

00:25:40.179 --> 00:25:42.790
jurisdictions in long term care but I

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.830
think it is important to take that next

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:46.720
stage so that we have a more in-depth

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.840
analysis to further support particularly

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.870
vulnerable populations thank you next

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.390
question CTV hi doctors Molly Thomas CTV

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:57.429
national news dr. Tam I understand you

00:25:57.429 --> 00:25:59.140
know more evidence of asymptomatic

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.820
symptoms has influenced the mask

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.580
recommendation but did we drop the ball

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.440
here I mean I think of smaller country

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.840
it's a Czech Republic Vietnam even

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.330
Venezuela have had mandatory masks in

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.400
place for quite some time

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.380
do you regret this decision and could we

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.090
have prevented the spread here if it was

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:19.179
a different decision I think the

00:26:19.179 --> 00:26:22.450
decision was taken to essentially ask

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.880
people to stay at home and they to the

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.890
quarren the the quarantine parents the

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.020
isolation of cases in quarantine of

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.260
contact has been the mainstay of the

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.050
recommendation so we have effectively

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:39.010
stopped and the B and D saturated that

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:40.870
epidemic wave so

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:42.790
that actually has been effective so when

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.850
I say they tried and true public health

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:49.690
versus those the identification of cases

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:51.700
contacts isolation quarantine

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.460
hand-washing physical distancing has

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:59.320
worked but you need so this is an added

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.559
layer on top of that and I do think that

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:05.830
it is important as we begin to reopen

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:08.530
that people no longer staying at home

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:11.770
more people will be going outside public

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:14.429
transit may be more crowded as a result

00:27:14.429 --> 00:27:19.150
this will help us reopen and add another

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.400
layer to that how do you go out safely

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.130
message I think but the message the

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.679
Canadians must remain all of those you

00:27:26.679 --> 00:27:29.530
know previous measures with this as an

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:33.070
added layer of protection and so then we

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:34.179
will still have to collect some

00:27:34.179 --> 00:27:36.100
information that kind of data to show

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.650
the efficacy of the non-medical mass on

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:41.110
top of everything else might actually be

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:42.850
quite difficult to discern because that

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.190
multiple things are happening but it

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.830
would be very interesting still to try

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:50.710
and look in the Canadian context what

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.590
this has produced as as people adopt

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:58.559
this measure more widely no regrets

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:03.910
we need to flexibly you know change our

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.460
measures as we get more information but

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.460
as I've just said B has always been if

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:13.780
you were infectious that was at the

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.250
beginning when we thought that the

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:18.340
majority had symptoms you do what opaque

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.500
phase covering on to prevent

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.910
transmission the other if you even at

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:24.250
home looking after sick person yes this

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.040
isn't sing but the mask so I think

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.730
adding on this layer as we know more was

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:34.179
the appropriate thing to do and I think

00:28:34.179 --> 00:28:35.650
we need to focus on the here and there

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:38.260
the whole hindsight thing people can

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.620
review but maybe on all future

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.470
respiratory outbreaks this will be the

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.980
actual norm to do and so I think we need

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.140
to sort of look forwards to what might

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:55.369
be the approach in Canada

00:28:55.369 --> 00:28:58.259
about testing um so you said on average

00:28:58.259 --> 00:29:00.689
we're testing about 28,000 people a day

00:29:00.689 --> 00:29:02.399
week and a half ago I talked to you I

00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:04.499
think it was 26,000 on average so we're

00:29:04.499 --> 00:29:06.449
like a slow crawl up to that goal of

00:29:06.449 --> 00:29:12.299
60,000 what is the holdup here so 60,000

00:29:12.299 --> 00:29:14.399
is the capacity that is already there

00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:17.309
for public health labs so your question

00:29:17.309 --> 00:29:21.779
is why are we only doing you know 28 or

00:29:21.779 --> 00:29:23.669
maybe higher some days they it is higher

00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:27.629
this is a bit of an average so this is

00:29:27.629 --> 00:29:29.939
something that at the highest levels of

00:29:29.939 --> 00:29:32.579
governments people are seized with a lot

00:29:32.579 --> 00:29:35.069
of this in talking to the chief medical

00:29:35.069 --> 00:29:37.619
for example in British Columbia they

00:29:37.619 --> 00:29:39.809
just said that their level of infection

00:29:39.809 --> 00:29:42.119
has really come down there's no one with

00:29:42.119 --> 00:29:44.729
much in the way of a respiratory illness

00:29:44.729 --> 00:29:48.809
they will of course widen everybody is

00:29:48.809 --> 00:29:52.109
widening their community testing to

00:29:52.109 --> 00:29:55.709
include even mild symptoms and sometimes

00:29:55.709 --> 00:29:58.739
people are not actually showing up and

00:29:58.739 --> 00:30:02.219
so it depends I think on the access the

00:30:02.219 --> 00:30:05.249
uptake of the testing on the ground not

00:30:05.249 --> 00:30:06.539
necessary because they don't have the

00:30:06.539 --> 00:30:10.349
capacity but also because of what the

00:30:10.349 --> 00:30:13.979
local Medical says feel to be in line

00:30:13.979 --> 00:30:16.919
with where they are in the epidemic but

00:30:16.919 --> 00:30:20.809
having said that we looking at

00:30:20.809 --> 00:30:21.959
absolutely

00:30:21.959 --> 00:30:25.499
how do we appropriately increase testing

00:30:25.499 --> 00:30:27.119
for example you've seen in certain

00:30:27.119 --> 00:30:29.129
provinces they're looking at the

00:30:29.129 --> 00:30:30.719
vulnerable settings a long-term care

00:30:30.719 --> 00:30:34.349
where they are looking at testing people

00:30:34.349 --> 00:30:35.699
in that setting whether they're

00:30:35.699 --> 00:30:37.499
symptomatic or not and the people who

00:30:37.499 --> 00:30:40.739
work there so there's so there's also

00:30:40.739 --> 00:30:44.339
systemic pilots or surveillance being

00:30:44.339 --> 00:30:45.929
done in different jurisdictions and

00:30:45.929 --> 00:30:46.949
we're going to share the information

00:30:46.949 --> 00:30:49.679
across the country to see if people can

00:30:49.679 --> 00:30:51.539
learn from each other as to what's the

00:30:51.539 --> 00:30:54.269
appropriate area for increasing testing

00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:57.239
so all that is at play but the key is

00:30:57.239 --> 00:30:59.639
that you need to have a sensitive enough

00:30:59.639 --> 00:31:02.759
system to detect any resurgence of cases

00:31:02.759 --> 00:31:04.949
and then clamp down on the contact so

00:31:04.949 --> 00:31:07.620
that is the fundamental principle

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.260
thank you next question on toast our dr.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.750
Jim Hite endemic Charles with the star

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.120
I'm well duck leads to what I was going

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.680
to ask you about but so specifically

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.600
since you've talked so much today on so

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.820
many topics about the need to respect

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.520
jurisdictions I'm curious what exactly

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.340
are the elements that the federal level

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.559
has proposed as a national framework on

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:30.780
testing and contact tracing that the

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.880
prime minister said was tabled last week

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:39.630
two provinces so I think or province

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.110
territories know that the sum of the

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.630
three fundamental aspects so the

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.580
criteria and the indicators are sort of

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:51.210
laid down in in the recommendations or

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:52.890
the guidance of the special advisory

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:55.290
committee which is the family how

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:58.980
foundation for which testing contact

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.570
tracing and then isolation and

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:03.450
Quarantine is the fundamental public

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:06.929
health underpinnings or principle for

00:32:06.929 --> 00:32:10.620
this next phase so everybody knows that

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:14.570
that is absolutely critical everybody

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.429
knows that we have to increase capacity

00:32:17.429 --> 00:32:20.460
to detect any resurgence and build a

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.860
capacity towards any potential increase

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.890
if we're to see that in the fore we hope

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:28.260
that we can sort of clamp down on you

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.570
know any sparks and introductions show

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:34.290
the suppression of any sparks is really

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:37.559
key I think the federal government's key

00:32:37.559 --> 00:32:39.570
role is I think the the Prime Minister

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:43.170
offered resources support to the

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:45.840
provinces as needed to ramp up their

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.590
capacity we are supporting of course

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:54.830
applies swabs reagents if there's a need

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:57.750
for any other further support as well

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:02.670
and you know committed to you know

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:04.679
looking at what else the province is

00:33:04.679 --> 00:33:07.230
needs we provide guidance of course and

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:11.910
these updated as as appropriate so to

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:15.450
look at what population needs to be

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:20.700
tested over time as well so actually

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.950
Phil national framework on testing and

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:25.890
contract tracing proposed then it is it

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:28.830
is it overstating the case to say that

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.560
you've proposed a national framework on

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.660
how testing and contact tracing should

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:34.680
go forward you've just referred to

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.540
guidelines that and criteria that you

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.610
came up with weeks ago so because

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.440
there's something new been put on the

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:44.010
table or no so I think that speaks to

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:46.740
the a higher level commitment that is a

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.530
wider strategy I think that is not just

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.710
of course the technical guidance but

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:54.390
looking at supplies and other resources

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:57.920
and support that would be required but

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.180
fundamentally we've always had a

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.700
strategy for laboratory testing which is

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.400
founded on public health guidance and

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.280
that changes over time so at the

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.620
beginning it was targeted more at

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.260
travelers because of the that's where

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.690
the epidemiology is at at the peak of at

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.120
the epidemic it is focused and people

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.699
are asked to stay at home and if they

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:23.690
have mild symptoms and so at that stage

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.699
the testing approach the strategy is

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:30.480
focused on the sickest people and areas

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.139
of outbreaks like long term care and

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:38.250
health care workers as we begin to get

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.800
this first way from the control and into

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.710
this recovery reopening phase is about

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.620
widening then that testing for example

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.630
to people with mild symptoms who would

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:52.290
never sort of in the previous phase was

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:56.880
necessary tested now we're expanding the

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.210
testing to particularly symptomatic but

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.750
with mild symptoms as well as a very low

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:06.900
threshold for testing everybody in under

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.570
certain high-risk settings whether it be

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.870
long term care acute care correctional

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:16.020
services shelters indigenous populations

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:19.320
that are at higher risk of their severe

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.980
impacts and so this is fundamental to

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:27.090
the strategy and also then how do we

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:29.250
widen surveillance and having

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.810
surveillance systems which are built

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:33.090
upon respiratory illness surveillance

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:34.500
but maybe there are others

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.050
surveillance approaches that we can take

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.620
we call those pilots or surveillance

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.240
activities which can take into account

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.070
for example the testing of asymptomatic

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:47.010
people so that is the actual approach

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.790
which varies and will be adapted so I

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:54.030
think is an adapter an adaptive testing

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:56.340
strategy which is now moving into the

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.220
next phase at the same time as doing

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:03.000
that ramping up our capacity in every

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.540
single channel that we can so the other

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.970
aspect of the strategy is that right now

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.640
there are three modalities we're looking

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:15.510
at one the existing ramping up after

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:18.930
laboratory based PCR testing that is the

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:20.850
key to testing whether you have the

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:24.300
infection now widening that from the lab

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.120
base to point of care so that's part of

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.460
the strategy getting point of care test

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.730
getting supplies particularly to cover

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:35.670
the rural and more remote areas that is

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.860
still a work in progress we're getting

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:41.640
gene expert an expert Express task heavy

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.000
to test kits now you've seen the lelouch

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.490
you've seen nineveh and others having

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:51.260
these supplies so point-of-care

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.700
particularly to coverage those areas

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.850
very important thirdly you've heard the

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:58.050
immunity task force

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.720
serology will become the third component

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.820
of the testing strategy one the primary

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:09.240
key aspect of that as you've probably

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.610
already heard is to conduct those Cyril

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.440
surveys which we believe will be

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.650
conducted pretty fast to uncover how

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.030
much of the population what's the

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:19.320
prevalence and how much of the

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.810
population has been infected that is

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:24.180
important for policy decisions not just

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:27.030
now but as we get a vaccine for example

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:29.460
in the future to know what the

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:33.150
population immunity is and where we

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.590
might be going with vaccination

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:38.640
strategies those same prevalence studies

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.370
together with actual research on the

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:44.490
immunology of the response to of the

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:47.710
body the antibody response you're in

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:50.170
aspects of immune response will then

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:54.190
help the further use of serology for an

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.410
individual diagnostic basis right now

00:37:56.410 --> 00:38:00.430
that is not ready for prime time so that

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:03.220
to me lays out the actual strategy and

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.890
the modalities or the testing approaches

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:08.920
but fortunately there's a lot of

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.390
research right now and there will be

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.910
other tests that could potentially be

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.980
available at which point those will be

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:19.020
also be scoped into the strategy itself

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:19.310
your line is now open

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:22.040
I thank you very much doctor tell my

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.440
question is about proper mask etiquette

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.330
a few weeks ago you were mentioning how

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:28.190
important this was but could you kindly

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:31.220
walk the public through how to take off

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.920
your mask properly when I go from one

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.410
store to another store can I reuse my

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:38.540
mask should I be putting on a new mask

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.310
should I be carrying a little baggy in

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:42.620
which to put my contaminated masks

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:47.710
what are what is proper mask etiquette

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:52.580
so I think I would also point people to

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:58.520
the website I'm trying to think Canada

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.040
dossier / coronavirus because it would

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.290
be easier I think for people to get the

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:05.300
different steps from from the

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:09.350
information as well and so yes so I

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:12.170
think one key some of the

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:16.790
recommendations pertain to materials in

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:19.240
fact there's actually quite interesting

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.970
studies now not now that there's more

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:25.070
interest in wearing non-medical masks

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:25.619
but

00:44:25.619 --> 00:44:28.740
but the most basic materials are like

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.450
cotton but you have to have different

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:32.400
layers so that you when you hold it up

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.829
to the light I mean the light doesn't

00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:36.450
shine through so there's different tips

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:39.869
as to what kind of materials use but I

00:44:39.869 --> 00:44:42.809
think the other thing is also fit so

00:44:42.809 --> 00:44:48.240
that you can't have you know gaping air

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.640
coming through the side of your mouth

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.519
for example so making sure that it fits

00:44:53.519 --> 00:44:59.849
your your face and etc so hand washing

00:44:59.849 --> 00:45:01.589
as we all know is the key to everything

00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:04.470
and frequent hand washing so before you

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.380
put a mask when you're removing a mass

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:10.859
is actually very important as well and

00:45:10.859 --> 00:45:13.349
try not to touch the external side of

00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:15.269
your mass for instance but certainly

00:45:15.269 --> 00:45:20.519
washing your hands and you can I think

00:45:20.519 --> 00:45:23.730
carrying a set lock bag or something is

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:25.109
actually important because then you can

00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:26.640
put your mask in it when you're not

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.740
wearing it now that is you're not

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.079
letting other people touch your mask I I

00:45:31.079 --> 00:45:34.410
think that's very important and and that

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:37.859
you are using it yourself and using the

00:45:37.859 --> 00:45:41.279
hand hygiene and of course the you know

00:45:41.279 --> 00:45:43.529
having washable materials that you can

00:45:43.529 --> 00:45:48.150
then wash in at home I think is

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:53.549
important but yeah don't use well you

00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:55.440
definitely don't let other people touch

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.210
you masca your whole concept is

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:59.579
protecting other people if it's your own

00:45:59.579 --> 00:46:01.769
secretions is your own secretions keep

00:46:01.769 --> 00:46:04.170
it to yourself and wash your hands

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:07.349
really well I think thank you doctor

00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:09.690
maybe I just add to that sort of a

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:12.059
practical sight so if you mentioned when

00:46:12.059 --> 00:46:13.410
you're going from store to store the

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:14.519
most important thing you know you're

00:46:14.519 --> 00:46:16.499
adjusting elastics this don't touch your

00:46:16.499 --> 00:46:18.420
face right you know it's a it's a you

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.730
know you put your elastics here and put

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:22.920
them put your mask on and of course I

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.559
think I think many stores now or many

00:46:25.559 --> 00:46:27.359
places in public have the obviously the

00:46:27.359 --> 00:46:30.749
the hand sanitizers etc so if you are

00:46:30.749 --> 00:46:33.150
then you adjust your mask and so on as

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:35.009
often as you can as dr. Tim says wash

00:46:35.009 --> 00:46:37.589
your hands or take advantage of the hand

00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:39.390
sanitizers as well but

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:40.680
the most important thing in terms of the

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.570
mask that we've seen is that it

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:44.250
sometimes gives people a false sense of

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:46.260
assurance and then they unknowingly or

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:47.940
whatever by fiddling with the mask they

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.530
end up touching their their face and as

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:51.630
we know that the most important parts to

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:53.220
try and protect and not touch because

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.990
that's how the virus enters are actually

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:58.170
your eyes your nose in your mouth that's

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:00.630
a really good point I think the key is

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:02.940
yes we have a lot of public health

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.550
always has a lot of you know key

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.850
messages in terms of because we're a bit

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:11.190
worried that with this added layer of

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:12.960
protection people forget other things

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.060
but I'm actually pretty confident in

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:16.830
Canadians I think people can learn and

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:20.460
adapt and this is one aspect that I

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:24.540
think we were all in as we go forward

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:27.350
together in the next days and months

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:31.650
Thank You LTF follow-up Thanks so we've

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:33.840
had a few questions from the public

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.730
about the wearing of masks and I'm

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:37.040
wondering I know you said obviously

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.880
circumstances are different across the

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.250
country but for people in urban centers

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:43.260
where there has been community spreads

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.320
would you like to see employers and if

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.870
they're employees in stores where masks

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:51.270
should joggers wear masks when they hit

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:53.730
crowded paths if you have folks over in

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:55.620
your back yard should these people be

00:47:55.620 --> 00:48:01.920
wearing masks Thanks so I'm sure there's

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.780
a lot of different situations and

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:06.930
permutations and you know local medical

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:08.580
offices are no doubt answering very

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:12.390
similar questions as people restarts

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:16.230
certain businesses they in every

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:18.960
jurisdiction there's instructions in

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:22.200
terms of providing a plan for your

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:27.900
reopening which includes in many of the

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.910
situation what we call the hierarchy of

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:33.150
controls and in terms of protecting

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:37.740
staff but also customers and they don't

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:40.380
it's not just mask again is an added

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.260
layer of protection because you actually

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:46.770
have to look at physical barriers like

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:49.260
Plexiglas you have to look at schedules

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.560
you have to look at how you're going to

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:52.980
reduce and

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.320
other people perhaps whether it's in

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:57.869
your office setting or the store in

00:48:57.869 --> 00:49:00.090
order to get that physical distancing so

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:02.010
that that physical distancing still

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:04.740
remains a fundamental aspect of this so

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:06.420
then you're looking at your specific

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:08.910
circumstances in terms of your workplace

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:11.160
what that workplace is who you're

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:14.190
serving and as to whether the

00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:17.630
non-medical mass is appropriate but

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:20.609
obviously again the fundamental

00:49:20.609 --> 00:49:24.119
principle being if you're in a crowded

00:49:24.119 --> 00:49:26.430
space you can't maintain that 2 meter

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:31.619
distance I think the outdoors is

00:49:31.619 --> 00:49:35.490
definitely less of a risk than indoors

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:39.510
so I think for people jogging if you're

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:42.180
on the outdoors and you you know just

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.490
sort of passing somewhere very quickly

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:47.250
that is a much lower risk than if you

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:51.770
were inside for sure

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:55.350

very next question cbc can I just add

00:54:58.339 --> 00:55:02.930
that I again patients and and compassion

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:06.859
is needed in even looking at mask use I

00:55:06.859 --> 00:55:10.609
just want to sort of remind people that

00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:13.910
for for people with disabilities we need

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:16.279
to make sure that we have some

00:55:16.279 --> 00:55:18.789
understanding as to their needs

00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:20.720
including the wearing of non-medical

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:23.599
masks and particularly for mass and the

00:55:23.599 --> 00:55:26.480
hearing impaired they

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.869
a communication partner for example

00:55:28.869 --> 00:55:32.090
there needs to be consideration for

00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:33.890
maybe having a clear face shield or

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:37.490
other means so that those who who are

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:43.670
hearing-impaired can continue to be sort

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:48.770
of considered in all of this so why I

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:53.660
think it's important for Canadians to so

00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:55.970
the think of this measure as being you

00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:58.190
protecting others and others protecting

00:55:58.190 --> 00:56:03.980
you is to generate that concept of you

00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:08.200
know solidarity really and so I think

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:14.050
please be very aware of those with

00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:15.650
different types of cognitive

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:18.800
intellectual disabilities those who are

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.900
hearing impaired and others so just be

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:21.560
patient

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:24.350
and don't assume that someone who isn't

00:56:24.350 --> 00:56:26.510
wearing a mask or is wearing something

00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:28.940
different doesn't have an actual reason

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:31.270
for it thank you

00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:35.420
CBC Julie Van Deusen CBC dr. Tam I'm

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:36.890
wondering if you could blame Canadians

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:39.109
for being confused it wasn't so long ago

00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:40.640
that you said don't bother wearing a

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:43.460
mask because it might protect others but

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:44.660
it wouldn't do much for you now you're

00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:46.850
saying if you wear one you protect me if

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:49.880
I wear one I protect you can you explain

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:53.720
the evolution so it's always been sort

00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.910
of protecting others a non-medical mass

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:58.490
medical mass aside that's to prevent

00:56:58.490 --> 00:57:01.520
with eyes covering on all PPE is to

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.260
prevent are you getting infected by

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:05.170
others particular health care workers

00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:08.150
wearing non-medical mass has always been

00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:11.330
a protecting others from if you're

00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:13.700
infected so it's always you protecting

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:17.270
others and so at the beginning it was

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:19.430
about people who have symptoms who

00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:24.410
should wear masks if you say in the home

00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:26.540
setting on an airplane if you found

00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:28.850
someone who is sick or going you know

00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:30.260
you have to go to the clinic or

00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:33.109
something then the sick person should

00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:35.330
wear the mask now here you're

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:36.859
considering if you think about it if

00:57:36.859 --> 00:57:38.819
you're in the community where there is

00:57:38.819 --> 00:57:41.969
actual being transmission of the virus

00:57:41.969 --> 00:57:44.549
just consider everybody as potentially

00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:47.130
being that sick patient because you

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.869
can't actually tell okay so that's the

00:57:48.869 --> 00:57:51.779
this change is asymptomatic people could

00:57:51.779 --> 00:57:54.209
potentially be infected or potentially

00:57:54.209 --> 00:57:56.160
transmitted again you're using that

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:59.160
covering to protect others so that

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:02.359
concept is the same all the way through

00:58:02.359 --> 00:58:05.579
and but at this particular time when

00:58:05.579 --> 00:58:08.039
people have used the tried and true

00:58:08.039 --> 00:58:10.469
measure of staying at home and physical

00:58:10.469 --> 00:58:13.109
distancing beginning to go outside and

00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:14.849
beginning to get to those more crowded

00:58:14.849 --> 00:58:16.829
places where you can't control that 2

00:58:16.829 --> 00:58:19.319
meter distance wearing the non-medical

00:58:19.319 --> 00:58:21.869
mass of facial covering again protects

00:58:21.869 --> 00:58:24.959
others from you if you happen to be

00:58:24.959 --> 00:58:27.779
infected and there's a reciprocal thing

00:58:27.779 --> 00:58:29.969
so if everybody is wearing a mask you're

00:58:29.969 --> 00:58:33.239
protecting others and by the other way

00:58:33.239 --> 00:58:35.849
around they're protecting you as well so

00:58:35.849 --> 00:58:38.009
could you just explain what exactly is

00:58:38.009 --> 00:58:38.819
new today

00:58:38.819 --> 00:58:40.589
about what you're talking about because

00:58:40.589 --> 00:58:43.439
in the past week or so two weeks you've

00:58:43.439 --> 00:58:46.289
said wear a cloth mask if you go to a

00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:47.880
crowded place like a grocery store if

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:50.069
you can't keep physical distancing now

00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:51.269
you're saying the same thing today

00:58:51.269 --> 00:58:52.859
except you're recommending it what is

00:58:52.859 --> 00:58:54.269
different especially if it's voluntary

00:58:54.269 --> 00:58:56.729
even in hot zones like what is the news

00:58:56.729 --> 00:58:58.469
today could you please explain that very

00:58:58.469 --> 00:59:01.829
clearly well there's no actual real news

00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:04.829
and if the key is that we're about to

00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:08.069
post the actual wording which I've been

00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:10.229
actually communicating for some time and

00:59:10.229 --> 00:59:12.659
it is based on a consensus with the

00:59:12.659 --> 00:59:15.390
other chief mark houses of health so

00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:18.179
that it's pretty provide further

00:59:18.179 --> 00:59:21.269
clarification I think across the country

00:59:21.269 --> 00:59:23.909
but there is flexibility as I said for

00:59:23.909 --> 00:59:26.269
the local medical sustaining on their

00:59:26.269 --> 00:59:29.279
situation and risk assessment to

00:59:29.279 --> 00:59:33.179
recommend that to their local population

00:59:33.179 --> 00:59:34.949
and you have to listen to your local

00:59:34.949 --> 00:59:37.109
public health big differences you're

00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:38.699
putting it on your website is that the

00:59:38.699 --> 00:59:40.979
news what you've been saying for like

00:59:40.979 --> 00:59:44.309
the last 10 days for that yes okay thank

00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:46.259
you thank you Julian last question Mike

00:59:46.259 --> 00:59:51.179
hello dr. Tim this this your you're

00:59:51.179 --> 00:59:53.430
testing 28,000 a day

00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:57.660
the lab capacity is 60,000 so basically

00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.700
we're not testing 60,000 today a day

00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.049
because we're gonna get false positives

01:00:01.049 --> 01:00:02.250
we're going to get false negatives it's

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:07.130
not it's not helpful but say there was

01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:10.380
30 clusters that just exploded out out

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:12.480
there do we have the capacity today to

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.480
do 60,000 lab tests a day if we need to

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.789
yes and it's not us or the federal

01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:22.710
government this is the public health

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:24.930
system in Canada so that is their

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:27.089
capacity so they can ramp up if there's

01:00:27.089 --> 01:00:30.990
a cluster that needed to be tested

01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:33.569
of course this capacity is distributed

01:00:33.569 --> 01:00:36.329
across the country if there is a

01:00:36.329 --> 01:00:38.700
particular area of country where let's

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.349
say you in northern Saskatchewan you get

01:00:40.349 --> 01:00:42.690
an outbreak the key is that we will

01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:45.240
support whichever jurisdiction was

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.000
searched if they need that too so that's

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.250
that's really important because the

01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:52.619
capacity is easier to reach if you were

01:00:52.619 --> 01:00:55.230
closer to the biggest centers we are

01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:57.839
going to be sort of supporting the more

01:00:57.839 --> 01:01:01.470
remote areas but even the point-of-care

01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:03.420
test is a machine you have to be trained

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.369
to how to use that but they can be

01:01:05.369 --> 01:01:07.410
deployed they can be reinforced so that

01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:09.119
what you brought up is a really

01:01:09.119 --> 01:01:11.220
important point if you spot the case in

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.260
the contest if there's a cluster you got

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:14.460
to move in really fast

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:17.430
and the laboratory capacity is designed

01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:19.740
to be able to do that ok and we have all

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:21.869
the supplies and stuff ready to go in

01:01:21.869 --> 01:01:23.970
case this is this hat this has happens

01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:27.539
tomorrow or a month from now yes so I

01:01:27.539 --> 01:01:30.270
thought this moment I know that there's

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:33.029
enough supplies but as you know every

01:01:33.029 --> 01:01:35.940
day all those situations could change

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:38.640
and we work every single day to make

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.109
sure that we have what we need

01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:43.770
so that is the capacity that we have but

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:45.839
that doesn't mean that tomorrow I may

01:01:45.839 --> 01:01:48.289
not tell you that there's a potential

01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:52.529
issue or something but the good news is

01:01:52.529 --> 01:01:55.049
that there's more more capacity and

01:01:55.049 --> 01:01:57.859
there's more more domestic capacity

01:01:57.859 --> 01:02:00.329
thank you system offender confirms the

01:02:00.329 --> 01:02:02.960
pathology

01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:06.750
you
